"caol ila 25 year old, 59.4%",Single Malt Scotch,88,225.0,a rounded and mature affair the 25 years in oak has made it a bit more refined and drier on the palate compared to younger expressions all the classic caol ila notes are stilltheremustard seaweed olives damp peat salt and pepper a touch of vanilla wafer anise smoked almonds and tarry rope add complexity those of you who prefer ardbeg 17 over the 10 and laphroaig 15 over the 10 will be attracted to this whisky when compared to caol ila's younger siblings but at $225 it's an expensive date isn't it?,59.4

"caol ila 'unpeated style,' 10 year old 2009 release, 65.8%",Single Malt Scotch,88,60.0,"caol ila makes unpeated whisky for blenders but it rarely gets bottled as a single malt here’s a very revealing opportunity to find out what caol ila tastes like without the smoke good viscosity and rather sweet showing thick honeyed vanilla gobs of fruit lemon drops lime tart ripe bartlett pear kiwi mint jelly and cut grass its sea influence finally emerges towards the finish with brine and just a hint of seaweed bruichladdich and bunnahabhain are now bottling peated whiskies and caol ila does just the opposite this is an interesting diversion but i am missing the added dimension of peat smoke in this caol ila
",65.8
"caol ila, 25 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,205.0,this is to be a permanent addition to the core caol ila range but it will raise a few eyebrows completely ignoring the current peat battle between ardbeg and bruichladdich and heading off into an altogether more refined and delicate direction this is a dignified and complex malt which doesn’t give everything up immediately there’s soft pear and guava on the nose and the trademark oiliness and distinctive peat are there but there’s a buttery quality too as well as some brine and spice apple pip and traces of aniseed you get a sense of its age late on with some oaky tannins and sharper spice but overall this is an unhurried complex and sweet whisky with just enough peat to keep it honest very impressive limited general releases excluding the us ,43.0
"caol ila 12 year old, 57.6%",Single Malt Scotch,88,79.0,"unusual insofar as this is the one chance a year that drinkers get to try caol ila’s other expression the unpeated version which  and here’s a bit of history for you  helped save the distillery during the lean period of the whisky loch in the early 80s rather than this just being caol ila with the peat stripped out the team made  it in a different fashion  but there are still hints of commonality 
for example the grassy note that usually lies beneath the smoke is the lead aroma here and it’s not any old grass but wet grass  like skidding on a football soccer field the mind keeps looking for smoke but apart from a hint of birch smoke which could come from the refill cask it’s whistleclean and fruity and with a touch of water fills with an aroma of toffee popcorn custard and pears 
the palate continues in this light fashion with melon balls and fruit cocktail this potentially bland fleshiness is given a perkiness thanks to the high alcohol and again a jag of acidity bizarrely on the finish i pick up slight saltiness a fun dram ",57.6

"loch lomond original, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,76,40.0,since a change of ownership in 2014 the loch lomond range has been revamped with the previous blue and black label single malt variants being dropped in favor of this repackaged nas expression farmyard aromas on the early nose then emerging malt and caramel discreet oak rounded on the palate with immediate citrus fruits toffee allspice and a suggestion of smoke spices persist through a slightly citric cerealy mediumlength finish,40.0
"knockando 12 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,76,48.0,since diageo has included knockando in its special release program it seemed only right to reacquaint myself with the standard bottling this is speyside in its maltiest guise the nose is reminiscent of breakfast cereal weetabix and bran flakes with a whisper of vanilla the palate is light and dusty and you get the impression that the malt just wants to scuttle across the tongue and down the throat as quickly as possible a shy wee mouse of a dram £30,43.0
"macnamara blended, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,76,35.0,this ambercolored blend from the gaelic whisky company has sweet barley notes and gentle spice aromas the caramels prop up the dominant flavor of coldpressed orange oil squeezed from the peel a crescendo of peppery spice marks the late phase and distinguishes the swallow before a finish of tangy citrus peel with a touch of clove perfectly straightforward blend but limited in scope like a linear dottodot connecting barley orange peel and spice,40.0
"robert burns single malt, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,75,40.0,this robert burns world federation arran single island malt is the calvados or poire williams of the whisky world there's no age statement on this whisky but it has the classic aromas and flavors of sweet pears prominent in very young distilled spirits the vanilla notes along with its pale color suggest a used bourbon cask i suppose one could treat it as an aperitif and possibly chill it down or serve it on the rocks,40.0
"edradour bordeaux finish, 11 year old, 55.8%",Single Malt Scotch,75,80.0,"citrus peel light maple syrup and almonds with emerging grape and vanilla somewhat elegant in nature but the flavors do not especially complement each other exclusive to binny’s beverage depot

"knockando 25 year old special release 2011, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,75,220.0,what a contrast with the standard bottling here we have knockando in a hugely active cask and sadly its fragile character collapses under the assault the nose is oily and sulphury with notes of sealing wax turkish tobacco and maraschino the palate is dry and tannic the opposite of what is needed for a whisky that is nutty and dusty in the first place,43.0
"benromach organic, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,74,75.0,"huge oak impact for such a young whisky fresh oak shavings dry vanilla and subtle toasted coconut throughout some dried fruit sultana and toffee up front but this is quickly consumed by the oak dry hot resinous finish not an old whisky but already showing too much oak

"the macallan lalique decanter, 55 year old, 40.1%",Single Malt Scotch,74,12000.0,"deep thick nose with sappy oak dried citrus old leather spearmint and background leafy smoke nicely viscous on the palate with similar notes as the aroma but midpalate the age gets the best of this whisky the flavors flatten out and the wood dominates through the finish as the leather notes linger
   it’s a rare treat to taste a whisky this old if you like lalique and have the money then this new bottling is worth some consideration because there are certainly moments of intrigue and pleasure on the nose and beginning of the palate but i have tasted several other 50plus year old macallans and i can say with certainty that the 50 year old millennium bottling and the 1946 vintage release were better and can probably still be found for a significantly lower price only 420 bottles available worldwide",40.1
"signatory distilled at kinclaith, cask #301446, 35 year old, 1969 vintage, 51.3%",Single Malt Scotch,73,1700.0,this lowland distillery only operated from 19571975 huge bourbon impact on the nose and palate along with vanilla coconut stewed fruit and dried wood spice  especially on the finish with lingering notes of anise espresso very dark chocolate and charcoal a taste of history for sure but this is a whisky that never was meant to be aged this long,51.3
"gordon & macphail distilled at port ellen, 1982 vintage, 24 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,73,250.0,"port ellen is going to just keep getting rarer and more expensive and the quality is going to get more variable this one shows the traditional port ellen characteristics seaweed tar charcoal damp earth vanilla salt white pepper but it just seems to flatten out midpalate leading to a fairly lifeless slightly astringent finish i feel like some of the guts were ripped out of this whisky bottling at a higher strength and not chillfiltered would have helped immensely

"benromach origins, batch #1, 1999 vintage, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,72,85.0,"origins is benromach’s new program to highlight different aspects of whiskymaking which i think is a great idea this expression focuses on the use of golden promise barley to make the malt which is then aged in a sherry cask unfortunately there’s so much sherry here that i struggle to appreciate the impact or distinction from the golden promise barley notes of ripe orchard fruit tangerine beeswax sticky toffee pudding and toasted almond lingering smoke and waxed fruit stays through to the finish a weighty benromach from the golden promise and/or the sherry i find the nose pleasant enough but the sherryinduced waxed fruit component that emerges midpalate is just too dominant

"distillery select 'croftengea' distilled at loch lomond, 9 year old, 1997 vintage, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,72,60.0,"quite pale in color very youthful and naked with damp peat leafy smoke charred oak and black licorice pears in honey and vanillatinged barley quite an eyeopener for a nonislay whisky it’s a little green and ornery certainly an entertaining whisky but a few more years in the barrel would round this whisky out meld the flavors together and add depth

"tomintoul, 'with a peaty tang', 40%",Single Malt Scotch,72,45.0,"youthful and somewhat brooding for a tomintoul i can tell there’s some young whisky in here as there’s a suggestion of new make spirit interwoven with notes of heather ripe barley raw peat and lingering smoke i like the concept but wish the young component the peated part of this whisky? was matured a bit longer

"duncan taylor distilled at cameronbridge, cask #3583, 28 year old, 54.4%",Grain Scotch Whisky,72,125.0,its best attributes are vanilla toasted coconut and tropical fruit but the rest of this grain whisky is a bit of a disappointment it is thin and at times harsh a paint thinner component is evident especially on the nose along with more wood on the finish than this thin body can handle two carsebridge grain scotch whiskies from duncan taylor which i have tasted recently were much better richer and creamier and with more balance,54.4
"distillery select 'craiglodge' distilled at loch lomond, 8 year old, 1998 vintage, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,71,60.0,"aged in a sherry cask which adds sweet notes of toffee caribbean rum waxed fruit red licorice and fruitcake to go along with the earthy smoke and lingering peat a much sweeter fruitier affair than the croftengea also reviewed here but behind all that sherry there’s still a whisky that needs a little more maturing

"edradour barolo finish, 11 year old, 57.1%",Single Malt Scotch,70,80.0,earthy fleshy notes with brooding grape notes and a gamey finish  the nebbiolo grape influence is obvious i enjoy barolo wine and i enjoy edradour whisky but the flavors in this whisky mix like oil and water exclusive to binny’s beverage depot,57.1
"highland park, cask #7380, 1981 vintage, 25 year old, 55%",Single Malt Scotch,70,225.0,"the sherry is very dominant and cloying which is unfortunate and i’m not crazy about the quality of the sherry or perhaps even the wood it was aged in i have great respect for both highland park and binny’s but this is somewhat disappointing for a highland park tasted twice with the same opinion bottled for binny’s beverage depot
