"johnnie walker blue label, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,97,225,"magnificently powerful and intense. caramels, dried peats, elegant cigar smoke, seeds scraped from vanilla beans, brand new pencils, peppercorn, coriander seeds, and star anise make for a deeply satisfying nosing experience. silky caramels, bountiful fruits of ripe peach, stewed apple, orange pith, and pervasive smoke with elements of burnt tobacco. an abiding finish of smoke, dry spices, and banoffee pie sweetness. close to perfection. editor's choice"
"black bowmore, 1964 vintage, 42 year old, 40.5%",Single Malt Scotch,97,4500,"what impresses me most is how this whisky evolves; it's incredibly complex. on the nose and palate, this is a thick, viscous, whisky with notes of sticky toffee, earthy oak, fig cake, roasted nuts, fallen fruit, pancake batter, black cherry, ripe peach, dark chocolate-covered espresso bean, polished leather, tobacco, a hint of wild game, and lingering, leafy damp kiln smoke. flavors continue on the palate long after swallowing. this is what we all hope for (and dream of) in an older whisky!"
"bowmore 46 year old (distilled 1964), 42.9%",Single Malt Scotch,97,13500,"there have been some legendary bowmores from the mid-60s and this is every bit their equal. all of them share a remarkable aroma of tropical fruit, which here moves into hallucinatory intensity: guava, mango, peach, pineapple, grapefruit. there’s a very light touch of peat smoke, more a memory of islay than the reality. concentrated; even at low strength the palate is silky, heady, and haunting, and lasts forever in the dry glass. a legend is born. (eight bottles only for the u.s.) editor's choice."
"compass box the general, 53.4%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,96,325,"with a name inspired by a 1926 buster keaton movie, only 1,698 bottles produced, and the news that one of the two batches is more than 30 years old, the clues were there that this blend was never going to be cheap. it isn't, but it's superb, rich in flavor that screams dusty old oak office, fresh polish, and sunday church, with spices, oak dried fruits, squiggly raisins, and a surprising melting fruit-and-nut dairy chocolate back story."
"chivas regal ultis, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,96,160,"captivating, enticing, and wonderfully charming, this first blended malt from chivas regal contains selections of five speyside malts: strathisla, longmorn, tormore, allt-a-bhainne, and braeval. red apple, cherry, raspberry fudge, peach and mango fruit salad, dusting of cinnamon, and dry heather sprigs. in essence, it’s rich and satisfying, with dark vanilla, apricot, bourneville-covered brazil nuts, and tangerine, smoothed over by caramel and wood spices, maltiness, and gingersnap biscuits. quite heavenly. editor's choice"
"ardbeg corryvreckan, 57.1%",Single Malt Scotch,96,85,"powerful, muscular, well-textured, and invigorating. even within the realm of ardbeg, this one stands out. the more aggressive notes of coal tar, damp kiln, anise, and smoked seaweed are supported by an array of fruit (black raspberry, black cherry, plum), dark chocolate, espresso, molasses, bacon fat, kalamata olive, and warming cinnamon on the finish. quite stunning!"
"gold bowmore, 1964 vintage, 42.4% ",Single Malt Scotch,96,6250,"deep gold color. surprisingly lively on the nose for its age. a complex array of fruit (tangerine, sultana, pink grapefruit, papaya, and the general overall citrus dna that you’ll find in old bowmores), with balancing notes of honey and vanilla. a hint of damp smoke and coconut. just like with black bowmore, this is a texturally soothing whisky on the palate, which continues to evolve in waves -- first the sweet honey, coating vanilla, and lively fruit, then turning quite visceral, with juicy oak, damp earth, deep peat smoke, and charcoal, followed by another wave of fruit (this time, dried fruit), finishing off with subtle charred oak and roasted nuts. this whisky is better than white bowmore, and it falls just short of black bowmore (which i rated 97), because it’s just a bit softer and less vibrant on the palate."
"bowmore, 40 year old, 44.8%",Single Malt Scotch,96,11000,"definitely showing its age, but not in a bad way — the distillery character is still there. solid foundation of thick, chewy toffee, old pot still rum, and fig cake. fruity too, with notes of golden raisin and nectarine. soft, seductive peat smoke, juicy oak, cinnamon, and brine round out the palate. excellent balance! one of the finest bowmore whiskies i’ve ever tasted (and, at this price, will probably never taste again.) (editor's pick) "
"the dalmore, 50 year old, 52.8%",Single Malt Scotch,96,1500,"the dalmore is one of a handful of whiskies that seem to be able to age in the cask for many decades and still improve. this one is incredibly viscous on the nose and palate (and very heavy on the tongue), with chewy toffee and old pot still rum. the classic dalmore marmalade note shines throughout, along with vanilla cream, an array of dried spices (especially cinnamon and evergreen), juicy oak, forest bedding, rancio, old armagnac, polished leather, tobacco, maple syrup, dark chocolate, almond macaroon, and subtle espresso. long, mouth-coating finish. the flavors evolve like waves lapping on the palate -- especially the interplay with the oak. i can’t drink this whisky slowly enough. a rare experience for the lucky few who can afford it. (price is per 100ml)."
"glenfarclas family casks 1954 cask #1260, 47.2%",Single Malt Scotch,96,3360,"a rich amber color and elegantly oxidized notes greet you. there are luscious old fruits—pineapple, dried peach, apricot—and puffs of coal-like smokiness. in time, sweet spices (cumin especially) emerge. superbly balanced. the palate, while fragile, still has real sweetness alongside a lick of treacle. it can take a drop of water, allowing richer, darker fruits to emerge. the finish is powerful, long, and resonant. superb, not over-wooded, and a fair price for such a rarity. £1,995"
"the glenlivet cellar collection, 1969 vintage, 50.8%",Single Malt Scotch,96,750,"it’s great that glenlivet releases whiskies under the 'cellar collection' label. it really shows the true potential of glenlivet. this bottling is classic ultra-matured glenlivet, and rivals the 1959 vintage cellar collection as the best one ever. an incredibly complex whisky, with notes of vanilla, ripe barley, coconut, and caramel. all this is accentuated by glazed orange, hazelnut, and a potpourri of dried spices. not the least bit tired for such an aged whisky. (only 800 bottles for the u.s.)"
"macallan 1976 vintage, 29 year old, cask #11354, 45.4%",Single Malt Scotch,96,1500,"classic sherry cask-aged macallan. antique amber with hints of ruby. thickly textured, complex, and quite deep, with notes of toffee, ripe pit fruit, raisin, apple pie, dried spice (cinnamon, clove, ginger, and mint), and a wisp of smoke. an exceptional, multi-faceted macallan! 
"
"the last drop (distilled at lochside) 1972 (cask 346), 44%",Grain Scotch Whisky,96,3108,"a remarkable beauty from the angus town of montrose. the elegant nose shows a dram at peace with itself; golden syrup, hay bales, ground hazelnut, liquid honey, french baguette, high mountain oolong, and rubbed spice blends. refreshing palate of honey, toffee, citrus, honeycomb wax, and a profusion of sweet vanilla. rich, sweet oak and deep pepper notes to finish. truly a sublime and venerable grain. (106 bottles) £2,400"
"compass box flaming heart (10th anniversary bottling), 48.9%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,95,105,"a marriage of three different single malts, aged in american and french oak. this whisky shows the advantage of marrying whiskies from more than one distillery (when properly done). vibrant, with a complex array of fruit (orchard fruit, sultana), sweetness (light toffee, marzipan, honeyed malt), spice (creamy vanilla, mocha, warming pepper), smoke (tar, smoked olive, coal), and lesser notes of toasted almond and beach pebbles. more smoke and tar on the palate than the nose, yet always in balance. well played! (editor's choice)"
"compass box the peat monster 10th anniversary special cask strength bottling, 54.7%",Blended Scotch Whisky,95,120,"as you’d expect, solid peat is the first thing out of the glass, but this isn’t just a peat beast. underneath are honey, dried fruit, and malt. the palate is all about balance, with honeyed malt, raisin, and oak spice all complementing smoky peat. a lush mouthfeel makes you forget it’s cask strength. a pure love note in a glass from compass box to park avenue liquor.  (park avenue liquor only)"
"johnnie walker blue anniversary, 60%",Blended Scotch Whisky,95,3500,"formulated to celebrate the 200th anniversary of johnnie walker. this is a fabulous whisky for anyone who can spring for the bottle. it is deep, dark, and quite powerful with a hefty malt foundation and sweeter notes of toffee and vanilla combined with resinous oak, complex fruit (both bright citrus notes and darker pit fruits), crisp mint, tobacco, polished leather, and heavy peat smoke. a tour de force of a blended scotch-as big as many single malts reviewed here. 
"
"chivas, 18 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,95,70,"an essay in balance on both the aroma and palate. silky layers of delicate sweetness (honeyed vanilla, caramel, light toffee) permeate through clean, delicate fruit (citrus, peach, currant), and subtle, complex dried spice. clean finish, with a hint of dark chocolate. a very versatile, very drinkable blend which suits most moods and occasions. indeed, a benchmark blended scotch. 
"
"ardbeg, 1974 vintage, cask #3145, 49.9%",Single Malt Scotch,95,20000,"cask #3145 is the lighter in color, and the sweet notes that balance the smoke and seaweed are not as deeply caramelized as cask #3542. i’m tasting hints of shortbread and caramel, which show through the peat smoke, tobacco, toasted nuts, firm spice notes (cinnamon, clove, and mint), and lingering brine. very complex. 
price listed includes the entire double barrel 1974 vintage set."
"ardbeg uigeadail, 54.2%",Single Malt Scotch,95,70,"with the ardbeg 17 year old off the market, it’s nice to see a new ardbeg in the line-up. uigeadail costs about the same as the ardbeg 17 did but, with uigeadail, you’re getting a much more interesting whisky. uigeadail consists of a marriage of younger whisky (from 1990 and 1993) with much older whisky matured in sherry casks. the marriage works exceptionally well, with the younger whiskies providing the classic ardbeg intensity many of us have come to expect, while the older whiskies contribute depth, maturity, and complexity. and bottling the whisky at cask-strength without chill-filtration ensures that none of the flavors are stripped out. this is an incredibly complex islay whisky, with its bonfire smoke, brine, and peppered olive notes balanced by a taming sweetness of vanilla, marshmallow, and toffee. interwoven notes of candied fruit and sugared almonds round out the palate. incredibly long finish. 
"
"balvenie 1973 43 year old, 46.6%",Single Malt Scotch,95,"$15,000 or $60,000/set","this expression was matured in a european oak oloroso sherry butt. overtly sherried, with figs, sultanas, cinnamon, and old warm leather on the nose. finally, fragrant, with milk chocolate-coated turkish delight. the turkish delight carries over to the palate, before the chocolate darkens to plain, with raisins, smoked ham, and cloves in the long finish. remarkably, almost no tannic oak. textbook stuff."
"bowmore 50 year old (distilled 1961), 40.7%",Single Malt Scotch,95,26650,"the whisky is sensational, a glorious mix of ginseng syrup, baked banana, semi-dried tropical fruits, and an exotic smoked edge. without the last, you could believe it was a delicate cognac. in time, there’s peppermint and guava syrup. a sip is all you need to reveal perfect, thrilling harmony: light nuttiness, pollen, subtle fruits, gentle smoke, and light fungal touches. it’s stunning, but it’s £16,000! whisky this great, even in limited quantities, should be fairly priced. points off. £16,000"
"brora, 30 year old, 55.7%",Single Malt Scotch,95,400,"astonishingly fresh and clean for 30 years in oak, and with incredible depth. slight oily texture. appetizing brine, with honeyed vanilla, mustard seed, green olive, seville orange, and lemon zest. underlying smoke, damp peat, and seaweed. put simply, brora at its finest. 
"
"lombard 'jewels of scotland' (distilled at brora), 1982 vintage, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,95,200,"bottled in 2004, but just recently put in circulation here in the u.s. (very strange.) it’s worth the wait. it’s fresh (even at 22 years old), appetizing, spicy, and briny. there’s a sweet foundation of vanilla wafer and caramel, with a slightly oily texture. white pepper, seaweed, mustard seed, lime, gherkin, and teasing gin botanicals add complexity. spicy, salty finish. a vibrant, dynamic expression of the shuttered original clynelish distillery. quite stunning, actually. find yourself a bottle before they’re gone!"
"brora, 30 year old (2009 release), 53.2%",Single Malt Scotch,95,400,"this whisky has all the positive aspects of a very mature whisky (depth, complexity) without all the negative ones (excessive oak, one-dimensional). very clean, but oily in texture, with honeyed vanilla, caramel, citrus (tangerine, orange, lemon), nectarine, olive brine, black pepper, ginger, cut grass, mustard seed, and just the hint of teasing smoke. briny, spicy finish. wonderful!"
"brora 2010, 54.3%",Single Malt Scotch,95,455,"though brora has acquired cult status, it has to be said that for a few years these special release broras went through an off-putting butyric phase, which might well have put off newbies to this legendary closed site, who must have wondered what all the fuss was about.
one nose of the 2010 sr shows that these days have been consigned to the past. this is classy from the word go. gold in color; the nose manages to be both overtly waxy — i’m reminded of waxed paper — and fragrant. behind that is coal smoke, rather than the heavy peatiness of earlier vintages (brora’s peating levels varied in its last years). in other words, this is robust and powerful, with an evocative aroma that speaks of old sea chests, the seashore, and vellum. hugely concentrated, with massed fruits — quince especially — following behind. this is amplified with a drop or two of water. 
the palate is unctuous and heavy. tectonic plates move more quickly than this does in the mouth. when it does, the oily/waxy textures and flavors move slowly — camphor, peach, membrillo, hints of citrus, and toward the finish a growing brininess (akin to olives) and a hint of smoke. elemental and one of the best broras for years. [not available in the u.s.]£280  "
"brora 35 year old, 49.9%",Single Malt Scotch,95,750,"maturation of this 1978 distillate has taken place in european oak and refill american oak casks. fresh and fruity on the early, herbal nose; a hint of wax, plus brine, developing walnut fudge, and an underlying wisp of smoke. finally, wood resin. the palate is very fruity, with mixed spices, then plain chocolate, damp undergrowth, gentle peat smoke, and finally coal. mildly medicinal. ashy peat and aniseed linger in the long, slowly drying finish. brora at its very best. (2,944 bottles) editor's choice"
"glenfarclas 1968 vintage, 43% abv",Single Malt Scotch,95,200,"it has been quite a while since we’ve seen a new glenfarclas here in the u.s. but, after tasting this whisky, it was worth the wait. glenfarclas is a rich, stylish whisky that ages very well, and this 1968 vintage proves it. it is very deep and mature, with complex fruit (sultana, marmalade) layered by sweetness (honey, caramel, and toffee). all those years in oak contribute another dimension to the whisky, providing a dry, oaky spiciness, polished leather, and a hint of tobacco-especially on the finish. never does the whisky taste tired or excessively woody. it expresses all that is good about an older whisky, without any of the down side. i’m told that most of the 1,400 bottles imported to the u.s. went to the chicago area. it’s worth taking the extra time to track down a bottle. 
"
"glenfarclas, 40 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,95,460,"glenfarclas has a proven track record for aging very well. i’ve enjoyed some amazing 25 and 30 year old expressions, in addition to some older vintage offerings. does this new 40 year old follow suit? absolutely! it’s complex and well-rounded, with great depth and no excessive oak. lush, candied citrus (especially orange), old pot still rum, maple syrup, fig, roasted nuts, and polished leather, with hints of mocha, candied ginger, and tobacco. a bit oily in texture (which i find soothing) with good tannic grip on the finish. a classic, well-matured glenfarclas — and a very good value for its age. (editor's choice)"
"glenglassaugh, 40 year old, 44.6%",Single Malt Scotch,95,2525,"an excellent example of an ultra-mature, sherried whisky done the right way. much darker and more decadent than the other two releases here. silky texture. rummy, jammy fruit, toasted walnut, leather, spice (cinnamon, clove), tobacco, and dark chocolate, with a foundation of juicy oak. tasting this whisky, you know it’s old, but you also know it’s very good. "
"the glenlivet cellar collection, 1973 vintage, 49%",Single Malt Scotch,95,1250,"a marriage of three casks, one of them an ex-sherry butt. the sherry is certainly evident, and this is more sherried than many of the cellar collection whiskies to date. opulent and seductive, with prominent fruit (glazed spiced oranges, ripe peach, and hints of pineapple and coconut), caramel-coated nuts, and vanilla custard. a peppering of ginger and cinnamon throughout. coating, soothing finish. polished and seamless, with no trace of excessive oak. one of the richest -- and finest -- cellar collections to date. anyone willing and able to cough up the bucks for this whisky will be richly rewarded. (only 240 bottles available in the u.s., beginning june 2010.)"
"highland park, cask #13308, 1973 vintage, 33 year old, 54.4%",Single Malt Scotch,95,280,"dark and decadent. notes of old pot still rum, roasted nuts, chocolate fudge, burnished leather, dundee cake, tobacco, and a hint of damp peat. when i drink this, i feel like i’m sitting in the study of a stately scottish mansion contemplating a fine, aged cuban cigar. royalty in a glass. (bottled for binny’s beverage depot) 
"
"laphroaig, 25 year old (2008 edition), 51.2%",Single Malt Scotch,95,500,"the flavors evolve on the nose and palate, with peat kiln smoke, fresh asphalt, damp earth warehouses, morning-after campfire ash, and old boat dock contrasting nicely with toffee apple, crème caramel, delicate raspberry preserve, and dried citrus. long, smoky, spicy, briny, seaweed, dirty martini-tinged finish. this whisky comes from a combination of both sherry and bourbon casks, and the marriage works. i also like that it retains some of its youthful brashness, while showing the depth that maturity affords a whisky. a delicious, well-balanced, old-fashioned laphroaig.(reviewing this whisky gave me an excuse to open a “fresh” bottle of its predecessor, the 30 year old, and here are my thoughts. the 30 year old is softer, mellower, drier, and more debonair. the 25 year old is bolder, more youthful, more dynamic, richer, and sweeter -- bottling at cask strength really helps here. both whiskies are very nice, but quite different in personality.)"
"the macallan estate reserve, 45.7%",Single Malt Scotch,95,215,"amber color. richly textured (great mouth feel), with vanilla fudge, nougat, ripe citrus, and ginger cake leading to a complex, spicy finish. great depth on this one. well-polished. my pick of the lot."
"dun bheagan (distilled at springbank), cask no. 1704, 35 year old, 1970 vintage, 50.5%",Single Malt Scotch,95,300,"quite fresh and appetizing for a 35 year old whisky, but not too surprising for a springbank. notes of creamy vanilla, burnt caramel, coconut custard, brine, and a hint of anise. complex, vibrant, and well-balanced. reminds me why i love those old springers. devotees will not be disappointed. a stunning whisky! (exclusive to astor wines and spirits.) 
"
"jewels of scotland (distilled at springbank), 1965 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,95,400,"bottled in 2001, but still in circulation and (fortunately) just finding its way to me. these springers from the ‘60s are getting rarer and quite expensive. this is a great example of why they are so coveted -- clean and well matured, with no sign of excessive oak. elegant sherried fruit dovetails nicely with polished oak and a steady stream of dried spices. look for citrus, nectarine, red licorice, coconut oil, ripe banana, and vanilla custard with warming cinnamon and brine. warm, spicy finish. very polished!"
"the last drop, 1960 vintage, 48 year old, 52%",Blended Scotch Whisky,95,2000,"a 12 year old blended whisky was created in 1972 consisting of 70 different malt whiskies and 12 grain whiskies.  the blend was then placed in three sherry casks, where it was matured for the next 36 years (highly irregular, to say the least).  the quality of the sherry casks is quite evident, as is the whisky's age.  there's substantial malt content here, too.  these three factors, along with the wide range of malt and grain whiskies, combine to create one of the finest blended scotch whiskies i have ever tasted.  it's dark, mysterious, and enormously complex, with notes of molasses, fig cake, dried fruit, tobacco, dark chocolate, old pot still rum, and polished leather, finishing with lingering cinnamon and mint.  there's no sign of this whisky getting tired at all.  i am pleased they bottled it at natural strength and didn't water it down to 40% or 43% abv, which could have ruined it.
(allocation information:  there's a total of 1.347 bottles, of which only 350 are being imported to the u.s.  they are available exclusively at binny's beverage depot (chicago), park avenue liquors (new york), and wally's (los angeles))."
"the last drop 50 year old, 50.9%",Blended Scotch Whisky,95,4000,"would you have gambled the last drop 1960 liquid in new sherry wood for four more years? the indulgent nose proffers maple syrup, buckwheat honey, roasted spices, blue grapes, pomegranate, raspberry compote, cilantro, pandan leaf, and beefsteak juices soaking into mushroom gills. the complex, lustrous mouthfeel is replete with a sheen of rich maltiness, molasses lashed by sherry before a dry, resinous finish. water brings an oily nuttiness, then further drops produce a silky, clingy texture. glorious. miraculous. victorious. (388 bottles only)"
"duncan taylor (distilled at invergordon), 40 year old, 1965 vintage, 49.7%",Grain Scotch Whisky,94,225,"a really stunning grain whisky. so rich for a grain whisky, with no excessive oak. lipsmacking notes of vanilla cream, coconut custard, ripe banana, sticky toffee pudding, rhum agricole, and delicate honeycomb. the flavors are clean, deep, nicely integrated and complex. single malt drinkers take note: this whisky will change your opinion of grain whisky forever! (a park avenue liquor exclusive.) 
"
"compass box the peat monster, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,94,60,"the formula for this whisky has changed slightly since its inception -- and i think for the better. they've added some laphroaig into the mix of caol ila and ardmore. this whisky demonstrates the layered complexity that can be achieved by marrying whisky from different distilleries and different regions. i particularly enjoy the rich maltiness and oily texture that provide firm bedding and flavor contrast to the classic islay notes: tar, boat docks, brine, smoked olive, seaweed, and kiln ash. more subtle cracked peppercorn, mustard seed, and citrus fruit add complexity. long, warming finish. amazing how a small change in composition can significantly benefit the overall flavor profile of a whisky."
"compass box phenomenology, 46%",Blended Scotch Whisky,94,180,"the nose has honey, caramelized apples, pixy stix, pears in cream, faint pepper, ground coriander, and salty driftwood. it’s teeth-coating with golden syrup sugariness, the silky texture meting out pears, apples, sweet barley notes, and crunchy spices, before a vanilla phase gives way to black pepper, licorice, and smoke. mouth-numbing finish of long-active spices over vanilla. (7,908 bottles)"
"johnnie walker the casks edition, 55.8%",Blended Scotch Whisky,94,300,"you don't mess with the johnnie walker brand name casually, so we expect greatness, and boy, do we get it here. this has a dusty, smoky nose with dried apricot and grape, and the whisky is gossamer-soft on the palate, with sweet pear and honey evolving on top of an oaky rich heart before a tidal wave of pepper and peat, and a delightful spice smoke and oak conclusion. magnificent. "
"the john walker, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,94,3500,"the pinnacle of the current johnnie walker range, this is a rare, inimitable blend of just nine whiskies. it exudes the aromas of ripe bananitos, whole mango, satsuma, vanilla seeds, barley awns, butter biscuits, and crystallized pineapple. the supple grain sustains indulgent, characterful malts creating a weighty, smooth mouthfeel. i’m smitten by the vanilla creaminess, burgeoning deep fruit layers, how it swells with a satisfying snuffbox smokiness. a beautifully styled blend delivering a captivating, sensuous experience. (330 bottles only)"
"chivas regal 18 year old ultimate cask collection first fill french oak finish, 48%",Blended Scotch Whisky,94,120,"an auld alliance renewed, this gorgeous whisky packs spicy aromas of peppercorn, star anise, and cardamom seeds, mingling with toffee squares, plum jam, dunnage earth, and dried sprigs of heather. rich fruitcake, jellied fruit, and bramble, then spices course through the mouth: chili heat, black pepper, and raw ginger. final phase has chocolate praline, growing milky, nutty, and soothing. exceptional lengthy finish with reignited spices. chivas 18 goes electric. (travel retail exclusive)"
"aberfeldy 14 year old single cask, 58.1%",Single Malt Scotch,94,181,"single cask aberfeldy bottlings are very few and far between, and this is a stunner! after hogshead maturation the whisky ultimately underwent a period of finishing in an ex-sherry cask prior to bottling. the nose offers sultanas, raisins, and hot chocolate. developing vanilla and a hint of over-ripe bananas. finally, burnt sugar and caramel. insinuating and syrupy on the palate, with apricots, dried fruits, honey, and sherry. gently spicy and warming, with licorice in the notably long finish. £115"
"ardbeg, 1974 vintage, cask #3524, 49.9%",Single Malt Scotch,94,20000,"cask #3524 is darker, with notes of sticky toffee pudding and chewy caramel that firmly support the polished leather, cigar box, roasted chestnut, smoked seaweed, tar, dark chocolate, and, on the finish, espresso. a meditative whisky. 
price listed includes entire double barrel 1974 vintage set."
"the balvenie vintage cask, 1976 vintage, 53%",Single Malt Scotch,94,800,"very spicy and complex, with incredible depth. once again, this 30-plus year old whisky proves the aging ability of balvenie. still quite vibrant and invigorating for such maturity. the classic balvenie honey note is there, but more reserved, along with graham cracker, vanilla wafer, citrus peel, raspberry (red and black), nectarine, and polished oak. long, spicy finish. another outstanding balvenie vintage cask. although, i look at the price and remember how shocked i was when the balvenie vintages were selling for $400.
"
"balvenie tun 1401 batch no. 3, 50.3%",Single Malt Scotch,94,250,"a combination of three sherry butts and seven bourbon casks. this is a complex, dynamic whisky, loaded with lush, layered ripe fruit (red berries, tropical fruit, honeyed apricot, raisin), toffee, oak resin, polished leather, and well-defined spice notes (cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg, clove). long, warming finish. (exclusive to the u.s.) "
"signatory (distilled at bowmore), 35 year old, 1970 vintage, 51.9%",Single Malt Scotch,94,500,"lush, thick fruit and chewy toffee soothes the assertive notes of earthy peat and leafy bonfire. underlying smoked nuts, brine, kalamata olives, and tobacco provide continued entertainment. a complex whisky that completely envelops the palate. this is an excellent example of a mature, sherried bowmore. 
"
"white bowmore, 1964 vintage, 43 year old, 42.8%",Single Malt Scotch,94,6000,"i like this bowmore better than all the previous bourbon oak-aged, ultra-mature bowmore whiskies that have been released over the past fifteen years (there have been several). the oak is always present, but not dominant. the whisky really evolves on the palate, just like the black bowmore releases. this emphasis here is on fruit, bright fruit: peach, tangerine, mango, ripe melon, and pineapple. there’s a soft, gentle side to the whisky, too, enhanced by sweeter notes of pancake syrup, orange creamsicle, and white chocolate. heavy oak notes emerge, along with teasing, earthy smoke, to give the whisky depth and bottom notes. the smoke and oak linger long on the finish. very contemplative. in short, an outstanding whisky, but not quite reaching the excellence of black bowmore. 
   (allocation information: 732 bottles available worldwide; 40 bottles are being allocated for the u.s., half of the quantity of black bowmore which was released earlier this year.)

"bowmore 1966 50 year old, 41.5%",Single Malt Scotch,94,"30,000","the third and most exclusive release in bowmore’s vault legends collection was matured for 50 years in bourbon hogshead #5675. the nose is fragrant and musky, slightly oily, with orange peel, developing vanilla, and green citrus notes. intense orange and peach on the palate, with black pepper, aniseed, and sweet oak. very persistent tangy citrus fruits through the extremely long finish. no negative tannic notes. (74 bottles)"
"brora 35 year old special release 2012, 48.1%",Single Malt Scotch,94,645,"previous broras in the diageo special release series have set the bar remarkably high, and this, the eleventh such bottling, does not disappoint. the component whiskies were distilled during 1976 and 1977 and matured in refill american oak casks. the nose offers lemon and contrasting vanilla and honeycomb aromas. musty malt and coal in the background. the citrus and honey themes continue into the slightly earthy, peppery palate, while french mustard and coal figure in the drying finish. 1,566 bottles."
"brora 40 year old single cask 1972 vintage, 59.1%",Single Malt Scotch,94,11824,"just 160 bottles of 1972 brora are available through uk world of whiskies and world duty free group stores. the oldest bottling of brora to date was distilled using heavily-peated malt. a big hit of oily peat on the early nose, with malt, dried fruit, and black pepper. mildly medicinal. the palate yields bonfire ash, licorice, honey, more pepper, and well-integrated oak. the finish is long, with peat smoke, plain chocolate, and tannins lingering in harmony. complex and rewarding. £7,000"
"brora 1978 35 year old (diageo special release 2014), 48.6%",Single Malt Scotch,94,1250,"this is the 13th annual release of brora, which has been aged in refill american oak and refill european oak casks. hessian and hemp on the early nose, with a whiff of ozone, discreet peat, and old tar. fragrant and fruity notes develop, with ripe apples, and a hint of honey. the palate is waxy, sweet, and spicy, with heather and ginger. mildly medicinal and smoky. dries steadily in the finish to aniseed, black pepper, dark chocolate, and fruity tannins. (2,964 bottles)"
"bruichladdich legacy 6, 34 year old, 41%",Single Malt Scotch,94,550,"the sixth and last bottling from the legacy series. legacy 6 is a marriage of six casks from 1965, 1970, and 1972. soft and mellow on the nose and palate, with unbelievably restrained oak for such a mature whisky. delicious notes of coconut, soothing vanilla, caramel custard, and banana cream, peppered with spice notes of cinnamon, mint, and teaberry that emerge on a soft finish that fades out gently. a fitting end to the legacy series. i’m sad to see them go. 
"
"bunnahabhain, 35 year old, 1971 vintage, 44.9%",Single Malt Scotch,94,700,"bottled to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the distillery. classic bunnahabhain-toffeed and quite nutty. almost rummy in nature, with rich molasses notes throughout and layers of sweetness. some salt emerges on occasion, as do notes of honey, coconut, and candied fruit, with a pleasingly dry, gently spicy finish to round everything out. surprisingly youthful for its age, nicely balanced, and very drinkable. a great bunnahabhain! 
"
"the dalmore stillman's dram 28 year old, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,94,140,"for the past several years, the stillman’s dram expression of the dalmore has been a 30 year old. this new 28 year old expression, besides being two years younger, is also slightly less sherried. in this instance, i feel that both have enhanced the whisky. trimming back on the sherry and oak allows the whisky’s trademark orange marmalade, complex spice, and briny freshness to shine through. this one is lively, dynamic, evolving, well-balanced, and always entertaining. the best dalmore stillman’s dram in years. 
"
"glendronach, 33 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,94,400,"matured entirely in oloroso sherry butts, this whisky is chock-full of lush fruit, roasted nuts, deep spice notes, and a hint of damp smoke. it is wonderfully integrated, with incredible depth and maturity without being tired-and it expresses a soothing quality that doesn’t quit. it is stunning throughout and more polished and rounded than the 1968 vintage released a while back, which, while enjoyable, was a tad sappy and a bit too oaky at times. this whisky is easily one of the 10 best new whiskies for 2005, and worth every penny. get a bottle while you can. 
"
"glendronach grandeur, 31 year old, 45.8%",Single Malt Scotch,94,700,"the new ultra-mature release, following its 33 year old predecessor (bottled by previous owners). it’s nice to see the higher abv, given that the 33 year old was only 40%. very soothing. quite deep on the nose and viscous (almost sappy) on the palate, with gobs of juicy oak and old oak (its age is obvious but not imposing), dark raisin, black raspberry, orange marmalade, roasted nuts, and freshly roasted coffee beans. all of this is peppered with cinnamon, ginger, and charcoal. polished leather on the finish. i like that it’s sherried, and the sherry is kept in balance. those of you who liked the 33 year old will also enjoy this one (assuming you can afford it)."
"glenfarclas family casks 1987 cask #3829, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,94,387,"this is the bomb. savory and lightly meaty, but sweetened by plum sauce; there’s even some strawberry around the fringes. you could see how with another 30 years this would end up like the ’54. elegant yet powerful, there’s sandalwood incense, marmalade, even a little dried mango. the distillery’s density is balanced by this fruit. lush with supple tannins and at its best neat. from a refill butt, this is an exemplary sherried malt. £230"
"glengoyne, 40 year old, 45.9%",Single Malt Scotch,94,5730,"aged in sherry butts, which is a departure from some of the older glengoyne vintage samples i have which show more bourbon barrel characteristics. it is a very fruity, spicy, textural dram, with spiced apple, red raspberry, strawberry, plum, golden raisin, fried plantain, and creme brulee. good grip on the finish, with grape stems and warming spice (cinnamon, cracked peppercorn, and clove). i love the balance on this whisky. it has aged very gracefully. (limited to 250 bottles worldwide.)"
"glenmorangie astar 2017, 52.5%",Single Malt Scotch,94,100,"the first bottling of astar was released in 2008. the 2017 release was matured in casks made of oak from missouri’s ozark mountains. the nose is floral, with rosehips, orange blossom, and milk chocolate-coated turkish delight. honey and citrus notes follow. voluptuous on the palate; sweet, even sugary fresh fruit notes, plus vanilla, cinnamon, and cloves. drying from coconut to plain chocolate in the lengthy finish. extremely accomplished. (individual reviewer rating: 93)"
"highland park, 34 year old, 1971 vintage (cask #8363), 53%",Single Malt Scotch,94,325,"rummy molasses and toffee sweetness intertwine with roasted nuts and bright, juicy fruit. suggestions of fig, lavender, leather, and tobacco throughout, with a hint of peat and polished oak on the finish. not quite as refined as the highland park 18 year old, but it makes up for this with its dynamic personality. a delicious ultra-mature, sherry cask-aged whisky. (a binny’s beverage depot exclusive.) 
"
"highland park, cask #7957, 1977 vintage, 29 year old, 48.5%",Single Malt Scotch,94,300,"a delicious, well-balanced, ultra-matured expression of highland park. toffee apples, molasses, and vanilla fudge provide a sweet foundation, with evolving notes of dark chocolate, dry spicy oak, tobacco, subtle smoke, and lingering brine on the finish. nicely done. (bottled for old oaks cigar & wine company) 
"
"highland park, 32 year old, 1973 vintage, cask #8375, 41.3%",Single Malt Scotch,94,350,"an essay in elegance. silky and soft in texture, and very clean. notes of peaches and cream, vanilla wafer, soft honey and fruit gum drops. subtler notes of tropical fruit (pineapple, lemon, coconut), demerara sugar, heather, and anise. polished oak adds structure and contrast, with a very elegant finish. hard to believe this whisky is 32 years old. it's lighter and more elegant than the equally splendid highland park 30 year old, which i rated a 94 in the last issue. (bottled exclusively for park avenue liquors.)"
"highland park 30 year old, 48.1%",Single Malt Scotch,94,350,"an exemplary highland park. there's certainly plenty of sherry influence in this whisky and it is complementary. (about 2/3 of the whisky was aged on sherry casks, and a lot of these casks were second fill.) the whisky enjoys a delicious foundation of toffee, fruit (lemon, plum, blueberries) and dark chocolate. it continues to develop and evolve on the palate, with emerging notes of heather, nougat, lavender, delicate peat and complex dried spice (especially cinnamon and nutmeg) to balance the sweeter notes. the extra alcohol is also a bonus, providing a drying balance to the whisky's sweetness. whiskies like this one remind me why i fell in love with whisky in the first place."
"highland park, 1964 vintage, 42.2%",Single Malt Scotch,94,6088,"a marriage of two casks (refill hogsheads). significantly darker in color than the 1968 vintage. darker (and more serious) in personality, too. red berries (strawberry, raspberry), rhubarb, plum, oak sap, vanilla bean, smoldering peat, coffee grounds, toasted almond, and dusty malt. the finish is long and contemplative, with notes of polished leather, juicy oak, and telicherry peppercorns. £3,750"
"highland park, 1970 vintage, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,94,3500,"this limited edition bottling consists of a marriage of both european and american oak. still lively for its age, and beautifully balanced. bountiful golden fruit (sultana, pineapple upside down cake, tangerine, overripe nectarine) balanced by soothing, creamy vanilla. a peppering of dried spice, chamomile tea, toasted oak, cigar box, and subtle smoke round out the palate. soft and seductive. (not available in the u.s.)£2,250"
"highland park 18 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,94,112,"introduced to the highland park portfolio in 1997. gentle peat, soft toffee, floral notes, and honey on the beautifully fragrant nose.  superbly balanced on the velvety palate, with brittle toffee, stewed fruits, peat, honey, and a hint of coffee. smoke and more toffee mingle in the long, elegant finish. "
"lagavulin 12 year old, 56.5%",Single Malt Scotch,94,109,"there’s precious little reticence about this beast, which leaps out of the glass blowing peat smoke everywhere — then comes raffia, lapsang souchong tea, seashore, wet rocks, elastoplast, talcum powder, bog myrtle (laurel), vetiver, and the aromas of a just-expunged peat bonfire with apples baking on it. huge and complex, in other words.
the palate starts with a fug of smoke being belched at you (non-peat freaks look away, now) then distinct saltiness enlivens the tongue before everything plunges down; intense sweetness takes charge for a moment before it shifts into charred creosoted timbers. 
this begs for some water, and when it’s added, out comes sandalwood and peat smoke and tar and an orris root-like character — it’s not often i get gin-like notes on lagavulin, but it’s here — which rolls over you as you roll over and succumb to its power. after this year’s sublime distillery-only bottling, it’s clear that lagavulin is in a real purple patch. superb. "
" lagavulin 12 year old (diageo special releases 2017), 56.5%",Single Malt Scotch,94,130,"this is the 15th special releases bottling of lagavulin 12 year old. matured in refill american oak hogsheads. the nose is smoky, with kippers, charcuterie, and bonfire embers, offset by berry fruits. on the unctuous palate, smoke blends with vanilla, green apples, and licorice, plus pepper and sea salt. peppery, ashy peat in the lengthy finish. (individual reviewer rating: 91)"
"laphroaig triple wood, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,94,100,"this is the first time i’ve been up for reviews here so i had a game plan: play it cool, mark tightly, let everyone know i’m hard to please. then they gave me this, the whisky equivalent to front row tickets to neil young on his current twisted road tour: not just a chance to get up close and personal with an old favorite, but to do so with an old favorite who’s on fire. laphroaig’s owners are intent on ensuring a big peaty engine for any new release, but this is a monster by anyone’s standards. it’s essentially quarter cask finished in oloroso sherry casks, so in addition to the intense charcoal smoke attack there are rich fruity notes; blackcurrant and berries. it’s an evening barbecue whisky. grill that fish until it’s blackened and crispy, drizzle on lemon, and as the smoke rears up in protest, sip this. big, moody, broody, fruity, and rich: what’s not to love? (travel retail and some european specialist retailers.) – (dominic roskrow)"
"the macallan fine oak, 17 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,94,120,"another of the fine oak series (aged in both bourbon and sherry casks), which will debut in the u.s. in march. of the five fine oak expressions that will be in the u.s. (10, 15, 17, 21, and 30 year old), this is my favorite, slightly besting the 15 year old. lovely sweet notes (creamy vanilla, light toffee, marshmallow, shortbread, and a kiss of honey) are accompanied by bright fruit (multi-layered citrus) and potpourri of dried spices, along with a hint of nut and wisp of smoke. a very refined and sophisticated whisky. 
"
"the macallan 1824 limited release, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,94,1900,"antique amber. the darkest and most decadent of the four. quite viscous and soothing, with well-layered notes of apple pie, marmalade, and maple syrup balanced by dried fruits, ginger, polished leather, tobacco, and resinous oak. one to sip and savor very slowly. (this whisky is much better than the last ultra-premium release, the macallan 55 year old in the lalique decanter, and thousands of dollars less.)  
"
"the antiquary, 21 year old, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,94,100,"drier than the 12 year old (reviewed below), with some darker fruit (black raspberry, blueberry) marrying with the brighter orchard fruit.  sweet up front - honey and caramel - with a peppering of spice (dried vanilla, clove, and cinnamon) increasing as the palate develops.  dry, oak spice finish.  lovely! 
"
"black bull, 30 year old, 50%",Blended Scotch Whisky,94,200,"well, what have we here? a blend of 50% malt and 50% grain (a very high malt content for a blend), and bottled at 50%, too! the whisky was blended first (very unusual), before being aged in sherry casks for its entire life. antique amber/chestnut color. full sherry impact, but never cloying -- the higher alcohol level and grain whisky cut through the sherry and add balance and drinkability. this is a fruity-confection delight, with raisin chutney, fig cake, orange almond scone, and chocolate-covered cherry. add to the mix richly textured toffee, old oak, polished leather, and a cinnamon-spiced tobacco finish. a rare treat! a great old blend that malt drinkers will embrace."
"black bull 40 year old 7th release, 47.6%",Blended Scotch Whisky,94,1400,"jaw-dropping: aberlour 1973, bunnahabhain 1968 and 1969, bowmore 1968, caperdonich 1972, glen grant 1974, glenfarclas 1966, glenlivet 1968 and 1970, highland park 1967 and 1970, and macallan 1969. it includes a 14% grain content from caledonian 1974, carsebridge 1970, girvan 1974, invergordon 1972, lochside 1966, north of scotland 1974, and port dundas 1973. an elegant, refined mélange of peach, pear, soft oak, and rose cream florals, with dark fruit, chocolate, and fine pepper. outstanding."
"blue hanger 6th release berry bros. & rudd, 45.6%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,94,84,"if you want proof that blended malts can be world class, you'll find it in any bottle of blue hanger. lovingly created by berry bros. whisky maker doug mcivor, every release has been exceptional. even by the series’ own high standards, this sixth release surpasses itself. the nose is fresh, clean, and citrusy, with wafts of sherry. but there are smoky hints, too. and it's that peaty, earthy note on the palate that gives this release a new dimension, enriching the fruity speyside sweetness at the whisky's core. the age and quality of the malt asserts itself throughout. this really is stunning stuff. £68"
"royal salute 62 gun salute, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,94,3000,"named after the gun rounds fired on royal anniversaries at the tower of london. heightened sherry tones with dark madagascar chocolate, brazil nut, fondant cream, and faint espresso indulge the nose. one heavenly sip reveals a velvety smooth whisky, thick and sticky, all revolving around the chocolate and nut, with a little support from dark fruits. you can chew over this for hours as the finish soft-pedals the main themes. a work of genius."
"scotch malt whisky society hunting hound on holiday 4.180 24 year old 1989, 51.3%",Single Malt Scotch,94,225,"from the nose you can tell this is a special whisky, with old, dark, lacquered wood, dusty cigar box, and sea salt combined with dark sweet cherry and a hint of rancio. on the palate it gets even better, with lush, dark cherry perfectly balanced and integrated with oak spice, salt, and peat smoke. there’s clear rancio in the center of it all that's utterly delicious. this stunner finishes with a long, slightly spicy, and entirely lovely finish. (park avenue liquor only)"
"collectivum xxviii (diageo special releases 2017), 57.3%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,94,164,"an incredibly complex creation using stock from diageo’s 28 operational single malt distilleries, this has minted toffee, gummy bears, raw gooseberry, fresh whole grain bread, and earthy spices shaken over sweet banoffee pie. rich fruit, cocoa, granular white chocolate, dark citrus, waxy caramel bars, nutmeg, cinnamon, and bitter dark chocolate. water stimulates green fruit notes. a beautiful sugared almond note materializes with sweet fudge and dried apple dipped in chocolate. £125"
"compass box oak cross, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,93,50,"this has long been a core whisky for compass box, but the latest version of it is spicier and fresher than i recall, and without doubt, it's my new best friend. virgin french oak heads help to contribute oriental and aromatic spices on the nose, with hints of melon and pineapple candy sweets. the taste is a delight, with spearmint, soft toffee, sweet citrus fruit, lemonade mixed with beer, and strawberry wafers. an array of spices from cinnamon to chili to ginger dominate the finish."
"compass box flaming heart 2015 edition 15th anniversary, 48.9%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,93,150,"without dredging up all the brouhaha over the particulars of the component malts, this exemplary whisky has a balance you could rest on a pinhead. earthy peats, discarded fish boxes, and crisp bacon rind combine in a smokiness you can really get into, while there is honey sweetness, macadamia nuts, and a bouquet of early summer flowers. it dances upon the tongue, sweet with toasted spices, anchored by dark citrus, and with a telling waxiness to the mouthfeel. get some."
"compass box spice tree extravaganza, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,93,140,"recognizably spice tree, but it’s richer, more dapper, traveling in style, and wearing better shoes. peanut brittle, toasted coconut, and pale, light sherry. honeyed palate with caramelized sugar, red apple, and red berry fruit before the gingersnaps and clove bite. it revs up with another spicy blast for the finish. a tasty fifth tenth anniversary bottling from compass box; just don’t let yesterday take up too much of today. (12,240 bottles)"
"compass box the double single 2017 release, 46%",Blended Scotch Whisky,93,175,"not seen since 2010, this yields vanilla frosting, menthol, spearmint, cream, dry spices, cedarwood, chopped herbs, and a discernable whiff of old grain. silky taste of butterscotch; it becomes more honeyed, with creamy vanilla, dried banana, malt, and a pinch of cinnamon, pepper, herbs, clove, and eucalyptus. the yin and yang of glen elgin and girvan makes an admirable exercise in precision, minimalist blending. mad as a box of frogs."
"johnnie walker odyssey, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,93,1100,"jim beveridge delivered these aromas of toffee apple, peach, and rich berry fruits by working with european oak casks. the smoke is timid, with hints of background salinity. the finely structured mouthfeel is where this triple malt whisky truly shines: the polished smoothness is exceptional. the flavor journey begins with honey, citrus, and swirling melted chocolate, building to a fire of squeezed orange oils, dry fruits, and pecan nuttiness before concluding with rich espresso, dark caramels, and plain chocolate. immaculate."
"diamond jubilee by john walker & sons, 42.5%",Blended Scotch Whisky,93,157000,"bright gold. amazingly fresh fruits and quince, slowly evolving into mango, blueberry, and a jammy tayberry note. at the same time, exotic spices like cardamom begin to build, particularly when the surface is broken with a drop of water, while vanilla pod notes develop. in the mouth, the grain smooths all the elements, giving an unctuous feel. there’s just sufficient oakiness to give structure and any smoke is far in the distance.  a triumph of the blender’s art. £100,000"
"john walker & sons private collection 2016 edition, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,93,850,"here’s your private audience with the inestimable mr. beveridge. after contemplating impeccably selected aged liquids from the big five distillers company limited (dcl) grain distilleries, he’s ready. three vattings representing cask character, distillery character, and highland single malt were combined in the final blend. fresh layers of lemon and honey mingle with wood smoke. a seductive soft and creamy palate, saturated with fudge and delicate vanilla fuse together in a study of honeyed perfection. a fine indulgence. the best yet. (8,888 bottles)"
"black bottle, 10 year old, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,93,34,"black bottle is unique in that it combines seven different islay whiskies with grain whisky. this produces a whisky with a beautifully rounded islay character that will satisfy the discriminating “peat-head,” the drinkability of a blended scotch, and plenty of complexity. for a blend, there’s heft to the whisky. i enjoy the interplay between the peat smoke, brine, seaweed, its firm, malty foundation and pleasingly dry finish. 
"
"royal salute stone of destiny, 38 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,93,600,"the last new chivas release was the 25 year old several years back. to be honest, i didn’t like it as much as chivas 18 year old. those extra years contributed an additional dry oak influence which i felt was a bit too dominant—especially on the finish. so you can imagine my concerns before tasting this 38 year old whisky. but this new royal salute has something to balance the dry oak that the 25 year old didn’t—lush, rich, sweet sherry notes. it’s quite fruity, with toffee apple, date nut cake, fig, molasses, and golden raisin up front, evolving to dried fruit, pencil shavings, tobacco, and polished leather, with subtle cinnamon and cocoa on the finish. my favorite of the entire chivas line is the 18 year old (which i rated a 95) for its impeccable balance, but this is still a very impressive whisky!"
"dewar’s 25 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,93,225,"aged for a quarter century and finished in royal brackla casks? count me in. the nose is highly attractive; a rich maltiness unfolds with vanilla oak, flapjacks, whole almonds, and gentle background spices. smooth caramels, chocolate orange, and a cappuccino note create a thick, weighty blend that melts gracefully into pools of darker chocolate. the mouth-coating finish has plain chocolate, dry oak, and coffee. brilliant liquid: smoothness personified."
"ardbeg, 10 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,93,55,"straw-gold color. on the nose, sweet toffee, citrus notes, seaweed, and spice complement a powerful peat smoke infusion. in body, it is thick and oily. on the palate, a somewhat sweet maltiness up front is run over by a powerful peat smoke locomotive. again, the whisky is enriched with citrus and pear notes, spice, and seaweed. the finish is powerful, long, and warming. the smoke lingers for minutes, if not hours. if you like your ardbeg to go to a phenolic extreme, you will cherish this one. this big, powerful whisky makes no apologies for its islay roots. and the fact that this whisky is bottled at 46% abv just makes this big whisky even bigger."
ardbeg an oa,Single Malt Scotch,93,60,"ardbeg's first standard release in nearly a decade, an oa is matured in virgin oak, pedro ximénez, and bourbon barrels, with component whiskies married in the distillery's french oak 'gathering vat.' the nose offers sweet peat, smoky lemon rind, ginger, and angelica. a soft and sweet palate entry is followed by hot peat, black tea, peppery cloves, and aniseed. black pepper lingers through the long, smoky finish."
"balvenie, cask #17893, 1974 vintage, 52.8%",Single Malt Scotch,93,600,"the newest offering from the impressive balvenie vintage cask line. honey, caramel custard, and seville orange notes, with evolving -- and increasingly noticeable -- dried spice, oak resin, and leather that integrates well with the sweet, fruity notes. incredible depth and complexity. the balvenie vintage reputation remains intact."
"balvenie 1973 vintage, 30 year old, cask #9219",Single Malt Scotch,93,400,"the last balvenie vintage whisky i tasted that was this old was the exceptional 1966 vintage. this new vintage has some big shoes (or should i say bottles?) to fill, so how does it stand up to the 1966 vintage? this 1973 vintage is equally as impressive. in contrast to the massive, evolving, sherry-influenced 30 year old reviewed below, this one shows more subtlety and finesse. it is also a very clean and polished affair-signs of an obviously excellent cask. a honeyed, malty foundation incorporates notes of dried fruit (orange, lemon), complex spice (vanilla, cinnamon, sandalwood), and subtle herbs. very contemplative. 
"
"balvenie 25 year old, 46.9%",Single Malt Scotch,93,250,"deep amber color. exotic aromas of honey, vanilla, and tropical fruit (coconut, pineapple, mango). medium to full in body, and rich in texture. the palate delivers what the aroma promises-honey, vanilla, and more tropical fruit, with a somewhat dry and rather lengthy finish. the balvenie distillery enjoys an excellent reputation. the older expressions are particularly noteworthy. they age very gracefully. this one is a pure joy to drink. 
"
"balvenie 1961 55 year old, 41.7%",Single Malt Scotch,93,"60,000/set","aged in a european oak oloroso sherry hogshead. orange marmalade and lanolin on the nose, with caramel and candle wax dripped onto old leather. full-bodied, with slightly bitter orange notes, plus nutmeg and aniseed on the palate. the orange theme persists into the finish as dried-out jaffa segments, plus edgy oak tannins. a highly individualistic balvenie."
"bowmore, 16 year old, 1989 vintage, 51.8%",Single Malt Scotch,93,90,"no frills here, just pure, unadulterated bowmore. this islay whisky speaks of its location in a very pure and natural way. i find invigorating brine, seaweed, green olive, and fishnets, along with the classic bowmore peat smoke. all these flavors are softened by gentle vanilla and honeyed malt, while background tropical fruit add complexity. 
"
"the whisky exchange masterpieces range (distilled at bowmore) 1990 (18 year old), 61.6%",Single Malt Scotch,93,191,"bowmore lovers rarely get excited about the smokiness of their favorite single malt. rather, they obsess about the tropical fruits that some old bottlings exhibit. here is one such example. initially the nose suggests verjus and linseed oil, but then peachiness rather than beachiness emerges. the smoke hits first on the tongue, backed up with mango and violet, then the tropical elements and the smoke play off each other up until a guava-laden finish. £120"
"brora 37 year old (diageo special releases 2015), 50.4%",Single Malt Scotch,93,1925,"an old special releases favorite, this is the fourteenth such brora bottling. distilled in 1977 and matured in refill american oak hogsheads, it is the oldest brora issued by diageo to date. 2,976 bottles have been released. leather, ginger, and stewed fruits on the nose, with smoky, dusty aromas. lighter and fresher than previous veteran releases, with cooking apples, cinnamon, fudge, dried grass, and light peat on the palate. sweet notes fade, leaving earthy, savory smoke in the long finish."
"brora 38 year old, 48.6%",Single Malt Scotch,93,2200,"another special releases staple, this is the fifteenth and oldest brora in the series to date. the nose offers hemp, oiled brown paper, lemon juice, ashy peat, and sweetening malt. the oily palate boasts sweet fruit notes, peaty toffee, and ginger. long in the softly smoky finish, with black pepper, plain chocolate, char, and licorice. diageo special releases 2016. (2,984 bottles)"
"brora 34 year old (diageo special releases 2017), 51.9%",Single Malt Scotch,93,"1,700","distilled in 1982, this expression was matured in refill american oak hogsheads. it is the 16th brora in the special releases series. ripe pears and vanilla on the nose; progressively more perfumed, with developing toffee notes. slightly waxy on the palate, with fresh-squeezed lemon and sweet background smoke contrasting with spicy dark berries. plain chocolate, sultanas, and raisins in the medium-length finish. a relatively restrained brora. (3,000 bottles)"
"bruichladdich legacy iii, 35 year old, 1968 vintage, 40.7%",Single Malt Scotch,93,430,"this gem is soft and seductive in personality. it is also very clean and still quite fresh for its age-obviously aged in an excellent cask. you'll find a bed of gentle sweetness, reminding me of coconut cream and vanilla mousse. a mélange of fruit (melon, black raspberries, strawberries) marries perfectly with the sweetness. fresh brine notes and licorice root emerge on the palate and become more prominent towards the finish. this legacy iii is more polished and rounded, and not as tired or woody when compared to the recent 40 year old bottling. and the 40 year old, at $2,200 a pop, is also about five times more expensive."
"bruichladdich 1984, 43.7%",Single Malt Scotch,93,"1,100","this 32 year old bottling was aged in twelve bourbon barrels and re-casked into fresh bourbon wood in 2009. it offers a nose of canned peaches, dates, marzipan, and a hint of milky coffee. rich fruit flavors lead on the palate: peach, pineapple, and mango, with vanilla and nutty oak. slowly drying in the finish, with warming spices. sometimes good bourbon casks are all you need. (3,000 bottles)"
"murray mcdavid 'mission' (distilled at clynelish) 1986, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,93,150,"deep gold color. fresh, exciting, spicy aroma of brine, exotic pepper, seaweed, and raw fruit, with interwoven notes of delicate peat and caramel. full-bodied and muscular. flavors are incredibly vibrant and dynamic-almost challenging-and are similar to its aroma. salty, peppery, intense finish. 
"
"cragganmore, 29 year old, 52.9%",Single Malt Scotch,93,300,"style: speyside single malt scotch color: shimmering gold aroma: very complex, with a potpourri of spicy, herbal notes. there’s a lot going on here. nice depth too. palate: similar to its aroma, nicely balanced, and evolving. lingering, spicy finish.

"cragganmore triple matured edition, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,93,135,"bottled for friends of the classic malts (which means most of you), this is cragganmore in early autumnal guise. dry leaves underfoot, ripe black fruits on the bushes, waxed jacket, chestnut, and a whiff of cedary smoke, opening into dried peach. the palate is thickly textured, with those fruits, dark chocolate, and pomegranate molasses. the immensely long finish gives you light pepper, smoke, and blackberry jam. cragganmore at its very best, and at a great price. £80"
"dalmore 1973 vintage gonzalez byass sherry cask finish, 42% abv",Single Malt Scotch,93,250,"a thick, lush whisky. notes of honey-drenched citrus, orange marmalade, chewy toffee and almonds, peppered with that classic coastal brine freshness and background spice i have come to love in dalmore. long, contemplative finish. this whisky packs plenty of freshness and liveliness for 30 years on oak and is a pure joy to drink. 
"
"the dalmore, 40 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,93,3000,"by far the softest and gentlest of the range, and oh so drinkable. hard to believe that this whisky is 40 years old, actually, as it shows no sign of excessive oak. instead, there are soothing layers of caramel and toffee as the whisky’s foundation. add orange marmalade and other juicy citrus fruits, cinnamon spice, graham cracker, and lightly toasted almond. a gentle, subtly sophisticated dalmore, and an interesting comparison to the much different, more visceral 50 year old. if i were a rich man, i could drink this whisky every day -- it’s so easy-going."
"the dalmore 1978, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,93,750,"this 1978 vintage release from the dalmore has been ‘finished’ for two years in matusalem sherry casks from gonzalez byass, following 29 years in american white oak. just 477 bottles are available. freshly-ground coffee, marzipan, dark berries, and rich sherry on the smooth nose, with milk chocolate and jaffa oranges. smokier with water. citrus fruits and more milk chocolate on the rich, full palate, plus roasted almonds. long and juicy in the finish, with aniseed and fruit pastilles. "
"dalmore 50 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,93,"60,000","this veteran dalmore was matured successively in bourbon casks, matusalem oloroso sherry casks, colheita port pipes, more bourbon wood, and finally, champagne casks. the nose offers orange marmalade, vanilla, milk chocolate, maraschino cherries, white pepper, and a hint of black treacle. sweet sherry and sultanas on the early palate, with developing prunes and licorice. the finish is extremely long, with increasing licorice, plain chocolate, wood spice, and tannic oak. (50 bottles)"
"glendronach, 15 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,93,95,"deeper, richer, more viscous, and more intriguing than the 12 year old (and not as sappy as the 18 year old). complex and intriguing, with raisin, orange marmalade, grape skin, sugar plum, cinnamon bun, raspberry preserve, mixed nuts, and coal ash. nice tannic grip on the finish. the best of the bunch, and very impressive!"
"glendronach 21 year old parliament, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,93,262,"part of the core range from glendronach, parliament has been aged in a mix of oloroso and pedro ximenez sherry casks and is non-chill filtered. quite sweet sherry on the nose, with fresh leather, nutty peach notes, cloves, and pepper. rich sherried fruits on the full palate, with more pepper, ginger, and plain chocolate. the finish is long, with licorice and oak tannins. not to be rushed!"
"glendronach grandeur 24 year old (batch 9), 48.7%",Single Malt Scotch,93,750,"a triumphant expression including whisky distilled in 1990, 1992, and 1993 and matured in spanish oak sherry butts. the nose offers creamy sweet sherry, figs, a hint of black treacle, cinnamon, and ripe cherries. the full palate yields sultanas, tangy citrus fruit, sweet oak, roasted chestnuts, and ginger. lingering bright fruit notes in the finish, with raisins, plain chocolate, and cigar boxes. (1,487 bottles)"
"glenfarclas family cask 1972 (cask 3551), 44.7%",Single Malt Scotch,93,599,"dark amber in hue, this shows immediate mature elegance with great sweetness — think of spiced honey or mead. there are some light notes of pecan pie and all the while that thread of the sod. glenfarclas can never fully escape its dark roots. there’s dried peach and fruit leather, toffee, and, with water, biscuits dunked in tea. the palate is autumnal and soft — fruit compote and peppermint. this is what you want from fully mature glenfarclas at its peak. (a u.s. exclusive). "
"glenfarclas 1953, 47.2%",Single Malt Scotch,93,9420,"the hits just keep on coming for glenfarclas. here we see it not only with enormous age but in relaxed mode in terms of oak. you can tell it’s old: the leathery waxiness and exotic fruits of whisky rancio; you can tell it’s glenfarclas because of the ever-present earthiness, but both are intensified into a new aromatic realm: gentlemen’s barbershop, rowan berry, and images of an old bonfire next to a gingerbread house. mysterious, subtle, and highly complex. £5,995"
"glenfiddich, 1973 vintage, cask no. 9874, 46.5%",Single Malt Scotch,93,600,"an impressive single cask bottling of glenfiddich. it really shows the natural potential of this distillery. nothing fancy here, just the pure elegance of glenfiddich. notes of shortbread, demerara sugar, and white chocolate, spiced with toasted nuts, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg. very clean and polished. 
"
"the glenlivet cellar collection, 1964 vintage, 44.7%",Single Malt Scotch,93,2000,"the fifth in a series of glenlivet cellar collection whiskies. this is a very complex whisky, with exotic notes of oak, sultana, vanilla cream, almonds, and evergreen. these notes are quite floral on the nose and well balanced, with no hint of excessive aging. the palate is polished, deep, and continuously evolving, with a long spicy finish. the oak notes reveal that this whisky has some years on it, but they in no way dominate or detract from the other flavors. an outstanding effort! this rivals the 1959 vintages as the best of the cellar collection releases. you’ll need deep pockets, though. 
"
"the glenlivet archive, 21 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,93,100,"amber chestnut color. aromas of mature oak, leather, ripe fruit, and toffee, are very deep and well balanced. its flavors are rich and enveloping, with notes of treacle, toffee, roasted nuts, and a long, spicy, woody finish that lingers. 
"
"the glenlivet xxv, 25 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,93,350,"finished in first-fill sherry casks for two years. my feeling on any whisky finished in a different cask is this: it should give as much to the flavor profile as it takes away. in this instance, i feel it has, and more. it’s not as nimble as younger versions, but the sherry, along with the extra aging, contributes a silky texture and a richer, fuller dimension to the whisky. i can still detect some of the peach, vanilla, tropical fruit, and honeyed malt i enjoy in younger expressions, but its key flavor components are toffee, honey-dipped citrus, red licorice, chocolate-covered almonds, and fig, along with dried spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, mint tea) that emerges on the palate and peaks on the finish. the flavors are seamless and elegantly balanced.
"
"glenmorangie original, 10 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,93,45,"fresh, vibrant, and beautifully complex. a clean, malty foundation accentuated by bright complex fruit, delicate spice, dried flowers, and gentle honeyed vanilla notes that linger on the palate. this is a wonderful whisky which is very versatile, but i can only imagine what it would taste like at 46% and unchill-filtered like the wood finish expressions.
"
"glenmorangie astar, 57.1%",Single Malt Scotch,93,85,"astar’s flavor profile is similar to glenmorangie 10 year old in many respects, showing a superb balance of sweetness, fruit, and spice. it’s not as subtle as the 10 year old expression, but it is creamier, richer, and fleshier, with loads of honeyed vanilla, coconut cream pie, toasted almond, vibrant spice (cinnamon, mint), and a basketful of citrus and summer fruits. the fact that it is bottled at 100 british proof (57.1% abv) just accentuates every flavor and helps to make this whisky quite invigorating. imagine glenmorangie 10 year old with a shot of testosterone. i don’t rate very many ten year old (or younger ) whiskies over 90. this whisky has certainly earned it. 
"
"glenmorangie pride 1981, 56.7%",Single Malt Scotch,93,2850,"glenmorangie pride employs the use of sauternes barriques to give a 10 year period of secondary maturation to a batch of spirit distilled in 1981. the result is a whisky with an intense, pungent, earthy nose; very complex, with polished old furniture notes, spices, oak tannins, and licorice. the palate is ‘full on’ for a glenmorangie; waxy, with sherbet, honey, and baked apple, then orange marmalade, sultana, and a hint of smoke in the lengthy finish. available july 1, 2011. price is approximate.  "
"the glenrothes, 1975 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,93,500,"a polished, very elegant expression with subtle complexity throughout. notes of squeaky-clean fruit (tangerine, peach, nectarine, kiwi) in light syrup. vibrant spice (cinnamon, white pepper, anise), creamy vanilla, and almond evolve on the palate, leading to a gentle finish. surprisingly lively for a whisky more than 30 years old. when i think of great glenrothes vintages, i go back to the 1972 vintage for comparison. both are comparable in quality, with the 1972 vintage showing darker sugars, more weight, and more roasted nuts. 
"
"the glenrothes “john ramsay,” 46.7%",Single Malt Scotch,93,1000,"made from whisky aged in second fill american oak sherry casks, distilled between 1973 to 1987. richly malty, with honeyed citrus, juicy oak, chocolate fudge, and nougat. more subtle floral notes, licorice (red and black), ginger, and chamomile tea. polished oak on the finish balances the sweetness. a great whisky to honor a great whisky maker! (only 200 bottles for the u.s.)"
"highland park, cask #691, 1983 vintage, 23 year old, 59.8%",Single Malt Scotch,93,150,"very sophisticated and subtly complex. perhaps the lightest-colored of the bunch. fresh, appetizing brine and spice (cinnamon, vanilla, white pepper, and clove) on a bed of soft honey and creamy vanilla, with just a hint of fruit. the notes are bright, clean, and tight. spicy, briny finish. a beautifully delicate highland park. (bottled for green’s) 
"
"highland park, 21 year old, 47.5%",Single Malt Scotch,93,100,"the good news: this is one of the best highland park whiskies i have ever tasted. the bad news: it’s the new release for travel retail (formerly duty free). it’s lush, well-balanced, and very complex. well-defined notes of toffee, candied fruit, and roasted nuts are accentuated by background honey, chocolate mousse, and smoke. here’s the icing on the cake: it’s bottled at 47.5%, which really allows the flavors to shine. if you’re going overseas, consider tracking down a bottle. 
"
"highland park, 40 year old, 48.3%",Single Malt Scotch,93,1900,"antique copper color, with some streaks of gold. a complex array of dried fruit on the nose, peppered with dried spice, orange marmalade, dark chocolate, and wood shavings. on the palate, the immediate impact is once again marmalade, followed briefly by bramble before drier notes of dark chocolate, wood shavings, anise, and subtle smoke emerge. dry and spicy on the finish, but never austere. a delicious, contemplative 40 year old highland park that has aged gracefully.

this is a permanent addition to the range. out of curiosity, i tasted it next to the other great highland parks (the 30 year old and several very good single cask bottlings over 30 years old). this whisky is in the same league as the others. its only down side is that it’s a lot more expensive than the others."
"highland park, 1968 vintage, 45.6%",Single Malt Scotch,93,3657,"a marriage of eight casks (seven hogsheads, one sherry butt). a whisky in excellent shape for its age. very clean and bright on the palate, with no excessive oak. notes of lemon tart, clementine, plum, honeyed vanilla, and polished oak, peppered with clove, soft mint, marshmallow, and subtle toasted coconut. clinging, mouth-coating finish.  £2,250
"
"lagavulin 1993 islay jazz festival bottling (bottled 2011), 55.4%",Single Malt Scotch,93,127,"an extremely limited edition issued at last year’s islay jazz fest, this was chosen by warehouseman iain mcarthur as a prime example of a ‘bodega’ sherry butt (see page xx for more on the ‘bodega’ process). it is, simply, massive, with concentrated soy/balsamic notes combining with hot embers, burning rosemary, fig, coffee, and candied peels. the smokiness is unrestrained on the tongue; all soot, earth, and a rolling wave of deep, pimento-accented meatiness leading to a kippery finish. magnificent.  (available only at the distillery)£80    "
"lagavulin 1995 feis ile 2014 bottling, 54.7%",Single Malt Scotch,93,167,"a sherry-cask lagavulin, this immediately shows a rich, mellow power with a touch of potter’s wheel, but it needs water to bring out sandalwood, beach bonfire, kombu, lapsang souchong, and bog myrtle. the palate is where it shows itself fully; resinous and thick, unctuous even, with that scented pine/juniper tea note shifting into paprika-rubbed ham, membrillo, currants, blackberry. i’ve a feeling that this period will be seen as lagavulin’s golden age. £99"
"lagavulin 25 year old, 50.9%",Single Malt Scotch,93,1200,"this cask strength, sherry cask matured expression was released as part of lagavulin’s bicentennial celebration. the nose offers new leather, tropical fruits, brittle toffee, and brine, backed by spicy peat smoke. smoky sherry notes open up in time. the rich, well-mannered palate boasts sweet peat, brine, muted sherry, figs, gentle spices, tangerines, and lemons. becoming more savory in the long, gently smoky, malty finish. very drinkable at cask strength. a great lagavulin. (8,000 bottles)"
"longrow 1974, 25 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,93,525,"gold color. peaty, smoky, mature aromas, with notes of damp earth, pencil shavings, seaweed, brine, and vanilla. oily, viscous body. flavors are similar to its aroma, with a spicy, salty, black pepper, dryish finish. 
"
"longrow 18 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,93,280,"straw/honey color. light to medium weight, with a slightly oily texture. shy on the nose, but makes up for it on the finish. fresh brine, toasted coconut, bright citrus fruit, and subtle mint on a bed of vanilla cream and honeyed malt. the peat smoke is restrained on the nose, but is more assertive on the palate, and it really kicks in on the finish, which is briny, smoky, appetizing, and long. the best longrow since the 1974 vintage. if it would only just open up a little more on the nose it would challenge the best from ‘73 and ‘74. (only 120 bottles for the u.s.)
"
"the macallan, 50 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,93,3500,"amber-chestnut color. aromas are very mature and so thick, one almost needs a knife to cut it. notes of dried fruit (orange, lemons, pineapple) and wood spices (especially clove), with more than a suggestion of peat smoke. thick, enveloping texture-like a warm coat on a bitterly cold day. very mature. one can easily deduce this is a very old whisky-the woodiness is evident on the palate. but it is not in excess. there’s plenty of dried fruit, enticing wood spices, and peat to keep the palate entertained, all the way through to its very long, dry finish. 
"
"gordon & macphail (distilled at mortlach), 11 year old,k 1993 vintage, 60.7%",Single Malt Scotch,93,80,"full-flavored, confident, and very dynamic. bright fruit, teasing toffee, complex spices, cereal grain, and underlying light leather notes are all tightly integrated. think an 11 year old whisky can’t be mature or complex? think again! a speyside powerhouse! (available in the chicago area.) 
"
"mortlach 18 year old, 43.4%",Single Malt Scotch,93,304,"deep amber in color with the green glints of first-fill sherry, this has bosky notes and meat—mutton and venison—plus graphite, bitter chocolate, and wet rock before layers of dried stone fruits and date. this is the most savory and bovril-like of the new range. the palate is feral and earthy; think mushroom with game pie, and rowan berries. deep, but with more dimensions than the previous 16 year old which, in comparison, seems like a blunt instrument. £180/500 ml"
"port ellen, 30 year old (2009 release), 57.7%, ",Single Malt Scotch,93,370,"port ellen whiskies are just going to keep getting rarer and more expensive. this old-fashioned whisky is beginning to show its age, but is still holding up nicely. it’s clean, with no excessive oak, and a soft, sweet maltiness for balance. earthy and rooty at times, with tarry rope, beach pebbles, leafy smoke, bourbon barrel char, black licorice, lemon peel, and hints of shellfish and diesel fumes (like following a boat in the ocean). long, smoky, lightly briny finish."
"port ellen 31 year old, 54.6%",Single Malt Scotch,93,455,"now the one that peat freaks wait patiently for every year, which makes it the bottling that produces the most debate. for me, this is up there with last year’s bottling, which itself ushered in a return to high standards after a slight dropping-off in expressiveness.
this is different, however. yes, the color is as pale as ever — has anyone ever tasted an over-oaked port ellen? — and yes, the nose initially shows all of the distillery’s austere notes: think of a wet fish counter and the sensation of the sea rather than overt ‘fishiness,’ while there’s also a chilled cucumber note. the difference is the sweetness, which is more to the fore, and also, it would seem, a slight dropping-off in massive smokiness. here the peat is integrated into the whole.
the palate has a numb spot right on the front, then wasabi-like heat coupled with olive oil. soon the sea rolls in and it stands there like some creature from the black lagoon covered with balls of tar, draped in wet seaweed, encrusted with barnacles and clams — and clutching a kipper. but don’t forget the sweetness that spreads across the tongue and slowly drifts into fresh spice and antiseptic. complex…and there’s a scant 3,000 bottled for the globe. [not available in the u.s.] £280"
"port ellen 1978 35 year old (diageo special release 2014), 56.5%",Single Malt Scotch,93,3300,"scarcity and the secondary market have driven prices up, so either buddy-up to a rich guy, or club together to try this. greater levels of cask interaction have added an extra dimension to a whisky that is often skeletal. the smoke’s in the background, as salted cashew, peppermint, tansy, furniture polish, and smoked meats take center stage. the palate is slowly expanding and smoked, with some chocolate and wax. finally, a port ellen that is truly, classically mature. a killer. (2,964 bottles)"
"port ellen 37 year old, 55.2%",Single Malt Scotch,93,4000,"the sixteenth special releases port ellen is the oldest to date. initially, sea breeze on the nose, brine, rock pools, and gentle iodine, followed by dried fruits, peat, and wood polish. full-bodied, very silky, again with brine to the fore, plus sweet peat, drying slowly, ginger, black pepper, and balancing tropical fruit notes. the finish is long, with burnt oak embers and licorice. diageo special releases 2016. (2,900 bottles)"
"port ellen 37 year old (diageo special releases 2017), 51%",Single Malt Scotch,93,"3,500","this 1979 vintage is the 17th special releases port ellen. it has been aged in refill american oak hogsheads and butts. the nose offers fresh-mown grass, ripe pears, and damp tweed, before smoked fish and bonfire aromas emerge. the oily palate features spicy peat, barbecued meat, and peaches in syrup. very long in the finish; smoky and earthy, with a hint of chili and mouth-drying tannins. (2,988 bottles)"
"springbank, 35 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,93,580,"antique amber color. mature complex aromas-especially in wood spice notes. in addition to wood spices, i also found notes of roasted nuts, coconuts, orange marmalade, anise, and subtle brine. thick and syrupy in texture, with complex flavors that echo its aroma. the depth on the palate is incredible! long lingering finish. 
"
"murray mcdavid (distilled at springbank) 1965, 34 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,93,200,"antique amber color. ripe, fallen fruit aromas laced with coconut, marshmallow, and almonds. the sherry cask influence is very prominent on the nose, but the springbank ""brine"" character still manages to fight through. full bodied, with a soothing texture. huge flavors with great balance and depth, consisting of exotic fruits, complex wood spices, brine, and coconut. long, lingering satisfying finish. 
"
"duncan taylor (distilled at strathisla), 35 year old, cask #7009, 45.1%",Single Malt Scotch,93,240,"aromatically fruity and quite full, with wonderful depth on the nose and palate. the fruit (golden raisins, apricot, red licorice, papaya) is balanced by restrained honey, vanilla, and fennel. the whisky is always dry but never excessively so. a delicious, ultra-mature whisky. 
"
"talisker, 30 year old, 51.9%",Single Malt Scotch,93,300,"surprisingly clean and youthful for a 30 year old, both on the nose and palate. complex, too, with a sea breeze freshness, vanilla malt, polished oak spice, smoked seaweed, lightly tarred boat docks, toasted nuts, and lingering telicherry pepper. mature, yet still quite powerful. rivals the original talisker 25 year old and the talisker 18 year old as one of the finest talisker whiskies ever released. 
"
"talisker 18 year old, 45.8%",Single Malt Scotch,93,65,"a sophisticated and refined talisker, if that’s not an oxymoron. but this is certainly true when compared to the 10 year old. this 18 year old is deeper too, with less of the fishnets, more of oak boat docks. less lemongrass, more fruit gum drops. there’s still that knock-out punch on the finish. there’s a fine line between polishing the rough edges of a beautifully powerful whisky and ripping its heart and soul out with a knife by dumbing it down. this whisky has not crossed that line. a fabulous whisky! 
"
"the last drop 50 year old double matured, 51.8%",Blended Scotch Whisky,93,4500,"tld’s sixth release captivates with dark caramel, brazil nut, polished oak, cacao, scorched earth, grilled field mushroom, and roasted coffee bean aromas. to sip is to submit to a discombobulating whirl of cherry and jellied black fruits replete with old sherry characteristics, replaced by an unctuous, oily base, torn asunder by seething spices of clove, pepper, and star anise. ever-changing. muted exit of dulled spice, browning apple, and eucalyptus. (898 bottles)"
"the last drop 1971, 47.2%",Blended Scotch Whisky,93,"4,000","it’s like someone just turned up the volume on flavor. cherry fudge, marshmallow, vanilla pod, ristretto, luscious caramel, almond-topped dundee cake, and wood spices. dark, oily, and muscular, with burnished orange, clove, licorice, and burnt char. sweetness brims over the tongue with apple, pear,
and malted barley as it softens to a beautiful velvety texture. this whisky’s great journey
is over. the baked apricot instigates an eternal finish (1,352 bottles, 300 for the u.s.)"
"cutty sark, 25 year old, 45.7%",Blended Scotch Whisky,93,170,"well-structured and masculine with its rich malty backbone and mouth-coating fruit. yet, there’s a silky, seductive underbelly that’s very compelling. notes of sultana, honey-drenched mandarin, ripe peach, thick toffee, and anise, with a peppering of spice throughout, especially toward the finish, where a hint of smoke emerges. the grain whisky enhances the blend’s allure by cutting through the whisky’s viscosity, making it very more-ish. i love the combination of drinkability, flavor, complexity, and balance in this blend. very versatile. single malt drinkers will thoroughly enjoy this experience. (note: at this time, this whisky is not sold in the u.s.)

"sheep dip islay blended malt, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,93,60,"there has been an excellent streak of islay blended malts recently, and here is another worthy contender from the spencerfield spirit company. this one offers the sizzle of bacon fat, thick clods of peat, cocoa, and breezy smoke. the rounded palate has sweet satsuma, spice, generous malty notes, and burnt caramel. the wafting smoke builds until it engulfs the back of the palate. you will be wanting one of these."
"glen moray 25 year old port cask finish, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,93,300,"distilled in 1988 and finished for an unspecified period in port casks after lengthy maturation in bourbon barrels. floral, perfumed, and very enticing on the nose. vanilla fudge, cocktail cherries, polished oak, and gentle spices. soft and sweet on the palate, with vanilla, overripe orange, cinnamon, and milky coffee. long and slightly peppery on the finish, with persistent drying fruitiness. complex and extremely accomplished."
"convalmore 1977 28 year old, 57.9%",Single Malt Scotch,93,248,"ok, confession time. this remains one of my favorite whiskies ever, a classic example of what long, slow aging in a refill cask can do for a whisky — increase its unctuous nature, bring out butterscotch, ginseng, honey, deepen the orchard fruits, and release a dazzling spiciness on the tongue. it has balance, it has finesse, and there’s not much left. £155(not available in the u.s.)"
"dailuaine 1980 34 year old (diageo special release 2015), 50.9%",Single Malt Scotch,93,2000,"that rarely-spotted beast dailuaine gets the special release treatment. this example has come from refill american oak and has immediate marzipan notes on top of the distillery’s fascinating mix of meaty density and sweetness. in time there are fat fruits, victoria plum, bitter citrus, faded green leafiness, and chocolate notes. the palate is ripe, rich, and profound, with a hint of tropical fruits cut with cacao. long, elegant, and complex, this is the best of this year’s bunch for me."
"douglas laing big peat christmas 2013, 54.9%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,93,76,"launched a few years ago with a dr. haddock-like cartoon figure on the label, big peat does just what it suggests it does…and then some. it's a mix of islay peated malts and includes some port ellen, but don't get distracted by that. instead, indulge yourself in the biggest, peatiest, oiliest, earthiest, grungiest, gunkiest slab of industrial malt this side of a leaky steam engine. this whisky just gets better and better."
"big peat 25 year old, 52.1%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,93,236,"peat has grown up to become the best version of himself that he can be. the mellow, sweet smoke makes all your cares drift away. it’s like walking on an islay beach through seaweed stranded at the high-tide mark. lemon lozenges, sweethearts, flashes of citrus, stewed apple, and growing smoke. the gentle, glossy, mouth-coating finish generates an urge to expertly puff smoke rings out through pursed lips.

"that boutique-y whisky company (distilled at macallan) 29 year old, 43.5%",Single Malt Scotch,93,560,"this has the poise and physique of a classic sherried macallan. hazelnut, mixed peel, peach cobbler, and wood spices form a delightful olfactory combination. warm, weighty sherry notes bathe the mouth with ginger loaf, milk chocolate chunks, and espresso in support, lilting toward a lip-smacking finish of peach melba and amontillado sherry. it’s increasingly rare to find a top-quality aged independent macallan, so don’t miss out."
"royal salute 32 year old union of the crowns, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,93,380,"containing some precious closed distillery stocks, this feels like the height of luxury with its aromas of clove-studded oranges, cinnamon sticks, rich chocolate, and caramels. it’s slick and mouth-coating, emitting flavors of butter toffee, orange, and melted chocolate, with a nibble of ginger sponge, jaffa cakes, and clove. it’s smooth and impeccably well mannered.

"exclusive malts (distilled at invergordon) 43 year old 1972, 48.2%",Grain Scotch Whisky,93,260,"this grand old highlander brings warm flapjacks baked with golden syrup, nutmeg, oak spices, toffee brittle, toasted muffin, cinnamon sticks, and beeswax polish. the oat breakfast cereals and caramel beckon in a fruit explosion of mango, burnt orange, raspberry, banana chips, and papaya. rejoice in that dense, ever-changing satin mouthfeel, with invergordon’s grain character only more apparent toward the end. soft spice underplayed on a dry finish. an enchanting find."
"the scotch malt whisky society pigs in plaster 14 year old (#4.1980), 59.1%",Single Malt Scotch,93,140,"this single cask, distilled at highland park, is an excellent example of why distilleries sell off certain casks. on the nose it’s highland park's signature sherry and peat, but on the palate it's a beast. monster peat smoke surfs on a lush layer of berry and malt. this builds to a peak with smoke, salt, and oak spice, bolstered by the high proof. a smoky, dry finish rounds off a monster whisky, different from highland park's style, but very interesting. (julio’s liquors only)"
"mackillop’s choice (distilled at mortlach) 1991, 56.6%",Single Malt Scotch,93,290,"full gold. weighty, but not oppressed by wood. full, rich rancio aroma, which brings to mind an ancient cognac. it is rich and powerful, but has great finesse and perfect balance: cooked fruit, some spice, a lot of waxiness, licorice…and then the distillery’s signature meatiness. the palate starts sweetly with ripe old autumn fruits, and soft tannins. this has everything you want from a mature whisky, and from mortlach, with added elegance. highly recommended. £198"
"compass box, flaming heart, batch #2, 48.9%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,85,"balanced islay whiskies combine peat smoke characteristics with a sweet foundation. they’re not one-dimensionally smoky. this whisky is an excellent example. this is a peat-laden whisky with refinement and grace. creamy vanilla, caramel, and honey harmoniously marry with persistent -- yet controlled -- peat smoke. crisp spice notes and dancing fruit throughout adds complexity. well done."
"compass box monster, 54.9%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,85,"(exclusive to park ave. liquors, new york, ny) this is a vatting of two single malts: the malty and sometimes smoky ardmore and the always smoky and spicy caol ila. the whisky expresses smartly complex aromas of smoky bonfire smothered with peat, with notes of tar, olives, freshly ground pepper, and seaweed. a sweet maltiness (from the ardmore?) binds the flavors together. on the palate, the whisky begins sweet, then the powerful peat smoke emerges, yielding to olives, peppery spices, and seaweed. the finish is long and powerful with the peat smoke again emerging and lingering on seemingly forever. a monster indeed. this whisky’s complexity demonstrates the virtues of vatting. many smoky whiskies have nothing else going on behind the cloak of smoke. this one does."
"compass box, the peat monster, reserve edition, 48.9%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,150,"compass box whiskies celebrates the fifth anniversary of the peat monster by thinking big: bigger intensity, put into a bigger bottle. this bold whisky is packed with islay and coastal character, showing tarry rope, brine, and a hint of seaweed, along with teasing smoked olive, anise, and mustard seed. there is some civility to the whisky: sweeter notes of vanilla wafer, baked apple, ripe peach, and cream attempt to soften the blow. smoke and tar on the finish. nicely done.

"compass box flaming heart 2012 edition, 48.9%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,115,"in my book, the bar can't be set much higher than it is for flaming heart and this latest version doesn't disappoint, though it does head off into a scuzzier, grittier, and more peaty direction than the 10th anniversary bottling, and has lost some of the black currant fruitiness in the process. no matter: this smolders with peaty and fishy intensity, works its way round to tinned strawberries, damson, and berry fruits, and emerges sooty and smoky. a big whisky."
"compass box peat monster 10th anniversary limited edition, 48.9%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,130,"peat monster is a staple compass box blended malt whisky, but this raises the bar significantly. the nose is “as you were”: peat reek, seaside, very islay. but on the palate john glaser's added some peaty highland whisky—probably a signature clynelish—to add a hint of licorice, a softer, fruitier smoke base, and through some virgin french oak, a delightful spiciness. compass box is in a purple patch. again."
"compass box great king street new york blend, 45%",Blended Scotch Whisky,92,75,"the original great king street blend was all sweet lemon and spice. this is something else again. this is a gutsy, urban wise guy of a whisky, rich in peat, with distinctive malty flavors—all in all, closer to a malt than a blend. that's because of the high malt content, and only the rounded edges and soft finish are gilded by grain. some fruit and spice emerge through the peat, but the smoke's what you remember—a master class in blending."
"compass box this is not a luxury whisky, 53.1%",Blended Scotch Whisky,92,225,"this surrealist compass box whisky mimics the dimensional challenges of magritte’s “ceci n’est pas une pipe” by raising questions about the luxury pretensions of whisky. is it the expense? packaging? good taste? masquerading behind a green apple, a bowler-hatted john glaser smiles enigmatically. sultanas, charcoal smoke, toffee, chocolate, sea salt, and warm sherry tones. the alcohol rides with dense black cherry, cacao nibs, colombian coffee, and dark fruits. trails of smoking fruitcake finish the experience. above all, buy and consume.

"compass box the circus, 49%",Blended Scotch Whisky,92,275,"ringmaster john glaser’s latest big top attraction: the nose juggles dark marmalade, almonds, sweet sherry, dates, and dried pineapple. flavors swing like a trapeze between deep orange, dried tropical fruits, nuts, and chocolate, with the silky composure of a seal balancing a ball on its nose. ridiculously smooth; if you’re looking for burn, try fire eating instead. knife throwers accurately pinpoint the finish: fruit, (thud) chocolate (thud), spice (thud). in this manner, mr. g. will challenge the world! (2,490 bottles)"
"compass box no name, 48.9%",Blended Scotch Whisky,92,125,"peatheads, listen up! yes, there’s pine needles, zested lemons, honey, sanded wood, nutmeg, and cinnamon within this islay-dominated blend, but it’s the billowing peat smoke that makes this special. it reeks gloriously of stacked fish boxes and heavy braided ropes on the pier. the dark fruit, baked lemons, cherry, clove, and cooked plum face entanglement in a labyrinth of shadowy stygian smoke. you could get lost in here for hours.

"compass box hedonism quindecimus, 46%",Grain Scotch Whisky,92,200,"how time flies! this eloquent blended grain marks cbwc’s 15th anniversary and the combination of these aged grains is idiosyncratic of whisky auteur john glaser’s distinctive taste. rich honey, apricot stone, crisp spices, vanilla custard, gentle oak char, and tropical fruits promise a real reward. succulently juicy, with melon, apple, and caramel, subtly paced, with chocolate and dark fruit infiltrating. slowly the sweetness depletes to black pepper and spiced roast meats. defer swallowing for as long as possible.

"john walker & sons private collection 2017 edition, 46.8%",Blended Scotch Whisky,92,815,"closer to the heart of jw than its predecessors, mastery of oak follows a methodically complicated maturation and blending regime. american oak characteristics, singed cedar spills, damson jam, stewed apple, and rhubarb laced with peppery spice, nutmeg, and clove. a dichotomy of flavors: toffee apple and rhubarb become piquant, verging on sour, with a parallel strand of honey and caramac. short finish of the last vestiges of fruit and spice.

"chivas regal 18 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,92,99,"it rarely gets better than this. vanilla, almond slice, toffee, pencil shavings, sweet oak, and mild wood spices on the nose. effortlessly smooth and delicate, this warms up gradually, with malt, dark fudge, leather, raisin, and tobacco notes before the wood spices, oak, and chocolate take center stage, ending with a warm, lengthy finish. this must be master blender colin scott’s most preciously guarded recipe. the man’s a genius!"
"chivas regal 18 year old ultimate cask collection first fill american oak finish, 48%",Blended Scotch Whisky,92,120,"and you thought all chivas regal 18 year old was the same. luscious toffee, cinnamon, nutmeg, chocolate praline, dry grasses, hazelnut, and just a lift of lime and peppermint. the palate has fudge-like sweetness, caramel, walnut cake, murmuring spices, orange peel, and toffee banana. water unlocks watermelon and a fruitier side to its character. the spices push hard through the finish as the toffee flavors relinquish their grip."
"dewar's signature, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,92,200,"johnnie walker blue, meet dewar’s signature. signature is dewar’s introduction into the ultra-premium blended scotch category. like johnnie walker blue, signature bears no age statement, but i’m told that a 27 year old aberfeldy is the heart of the blend. the first release consists only of 1,000 individually numbered bottles, and they’re only available in new york city. i’m always a little skeptical of very expensive blends that come in fancy packages. there are some very good, reasonably priced blends in the 10-20 year old range, and the expensive ones are often only marginally better, if that. but i like this whisky a whole lot better than the standard dewar’s white label, and it is also superior to dewar’s 12 year old-a whisky which i find to be quite enjoyable. while maintaining the dewar’s profile-nicely balanced-this whisky offers greater depth, maturity, and complexity without being too woody-a creamy, malty foundation makes sure of that. the whisky expresses a rich, honeyed maltiness which combines nicely with notes of golden raisins, vanilla, caramel, and crème brûlée, with just a hint of spicy oak notes for complexity. signature is a different style when compared to johnnie walker blue-it’s more elegant and bashful-but, like blue, i put signature on my short list of the finest blends on the market.

"duncan taylor “nc2” (distilled at aberlour), 16 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,92,80,"this whisky packs a lot of clean, complex, and well-balanced flavors. it features a creamy, layered, malty-sweet foundation (vanilla, caramel, toffee) chock full of bright fruit (golden raisin, honeyed orchard fruit, currant), rounded out by firm, dried spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, mint) that dances on the palate. long, warming, spicy finish. nicely done!"
"aberlour 18 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,92,125,"this has a significant proportion of sherry wood and it marks a real step up from its younger stablemates. it boasts a stylish nose of old leathery cigar boxes, vanilla, and orange marmalade. syrupy on the palate, with oranges, sweet sherry, honey, and figs. spicy oak, caramel, citrus fruits, and aniseed in the lengthy finish."
"aberfeldy single cask (cask no. 5) 16 year old, 57.4%",Single Malt Scotch,92,250,"from a sherry cask. bright and lively. quite fruity, with notes of golden raisin, pineapple, nectarine, and tangerine. the fruit is balanced by honeyed malt and light caramel. a dusting of vanilla, cinnamon, and hint of cocoa, with black licorice on the finish. lush and mouth-coating. the best of the aberfeldy whiskies i’ve tasted to date. (new hampshire only)"
"ardbeg airidh nam beist, 1990 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,92,100,"some of the best intensely smoky, peaty islay whiskies are balanced with a foundation of malty sweetness. this whisky is an excellent example. a sinewy malt with the classic bold notes of kiln smoke, peat, tarry rope, and coal ash. sweeter notes of honeyed malt, ripe vanilla, chocolate fudge, and toasted marshmallow temper and sooth the palate, along with background berry confit. the smoke lingers long on the palate. ardbeg devotees will not be disappointed. 
"
"ardbeg alligator, 51.2%",Single Malt Scotch,92,95,"similar to the standard ardbeg 10 year old, except that a portion of the whisky was aged in heavily charred barrels (referred to as an “alligator” char). an aggressive whisky — even for ardbeg — with a leathery texture throughout. dynamic too, with coal tar, soot, bourbon barrel char, espresso, cocoa, licorice root, smoked fish, and a hint of ginger. there’s a nice creamy vanilla underbelly to balance the aggressiveness and (at least partially) muzzle the alligator. "
"ardmore 100th anniversary 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,92,155,"this isn’t quite a distillery-only bottling so much as a bottle only available at the distillery — which isn’t exactly the same thing. bottled more than 10 years ago to mark the distillery’s centenary, incredibly a small amount is still available, and it is well worth pursuing.
until relatively recently ardmore was an industry secret, cherished by those in the know. but the peaty and feisty no-age-statement ardmore traditional has introduced the malt to a new generation of drinkers, and last year’s sweet and fruity 25 year old suggested that the distillery has a potentially diverse range of future treasures to be excited about. this bottling is light, soft, sweet, and juicy. orange flavors and peat team up to steer a middle way for what is a delicious and highly more-ish malt. its only flaw is in the finish, which dies away too quickly for this palate. perhaps a slightly higher strength would have improved it. no matter, it’s like the fade out of the guitar solo at the end of your favorite track; it’s a bit frustrating because you want it to go on and on, but it doesn’t stop you going back and listening to it all again.

"benriach pedro ximinez finish, (cask #7165), 1995 vintage, 52.3%",Single Malt Scotch,92,95,"this is the heavily peated expression of benriach. (benriach does not differentiate their peated expressions with a different name, as springbank does with longrow, or tobermory with ledaig.) it’s also finished with the dark, lush “px” sherry. both influences are very evident, with the deep, heavy, earthy, smoky notes complemented by dark, fleshy, dried fruit. i think the two different influences marry very nicely here and i really enjoy drinking it. (bottling at cask strength is a bonus!)"
"benromach 1974 (cask 1583), 49.1%",Single Malt Scotch,92,1600,"this 41 year old single cask was aged in a sherry butt and interacted magnificently with that wood. the nose offers peeled red apples, sultanas, honey, fudge, milk chocolate, and american cream soda. balanced and harmonious throughout, the palate yields remarkably fresh orchard fruits, pipe tobacco, black pepper, and ginger. long in the finish, with cinnamon drying to dark chocolate, and slightly smoky, unobtrusively tannic oak. a 1970s classic!"
"benromach heritage 1973, 48.9%",Single Malt Scotch,92,1722,"this 42 year old expression was matured in a single american oak hogshead (#4606) and offers a lovely mature, fruity nose, especially peaches and pineapple, plus vanilla and marzipan. smooth and rich on the palate, with sherry, hessian, and spicy pineapple. dries steadily but satisfyingly, with a hint of smoky fruit. another veteran classic from the team at forres.

"bowmore oloroso sherry cask, 1964 vintage",Single Malt Scotch,92,1500,"mahogany color. medium to full in body, and rich. aroma and flavors are very reminiscent of the ""black bowmore"" releases: burnt fruit, roasted nuts, fruit cake, polished leather, wood resin, and just a teasing of smoke. there is a harmonious balance between the dry oak spices and the sweet, fruity oloroso sherry notes. soothing finish.
   style: islay single malt scotch whisky. price: approx. $1,500. only 300 bottles, available this fall at specialty retailers nationwide. 
   this whisky was distilled around the same time-and is very similar in flavor profile-as the legendary ""black bowmore"" whiskies released several years ago. comparing this release with the black bowmore is only natural. having tried this whisky next to the previous black bowmores, i can happily say that this whisky is as good as they are (although a lot more expensive). while the original black bowmore whiskies are a little bigger and fuller in body (especially towards the finish), this new 1964 vintage is a tad softer, sweeter, more rounded, and more seductive. this is a very contemplative whisky-the more attention you devote to it, the more pleasure it gives you."
"bruichladdich 'pc-5', 63.5%",Single Malt Scotch,92,120,"this is a five year old expression of the more highly peated bruichladdich whisky being referred to as port charlotte (named after the now-silent distillery down the road from bruichladdich). more highly peated indeed. if you like your smoky islay whiskies young and masculine, this one is for you. it’s like sticking your head in a peat-fired kiln. but there’s more to this whisky than massive smoke. there are underlying notes of kippers, soot, and tar. with further investigation, there are spice notes of black pepper and black licorice stick. what really makes this whisky multi-dimensional and balanced is its sweet underbelly of thick toffee, jammy fruit, and almond butter. youthful, but not immature. 
"
"bruichladdich 1985, 48.7%",Single Malt Scotch,92,"1,100","originally filled into 22 third-fill bourbon casks, this 32 year old was re-casked into first-fill bourbon barrels in 2012, then finished in french oak wine barrels. fresh peaches on the nose, with vanilla fudge, honey, and ginger. fruity and spicy on the luscious palate, with orange, cinnamon, and coconut. long in the finish, with ever-present fruitiness, plus prickly chili notes. (4,200 bottles)"
"bunnahabhain 18 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,92,95,"creamier than the 12-bigger too, with broader shoulders and greater depth. fairly sweet up front, with vanilla-laced malt, chewy toffee, and ripe fruit. almond fudge and a hint of espresso add intrigue, while dry wood spice on the finish underpins the whisky's characteristic sweetness. contemplative and complex."
"the dalmore, 1981 vintage, amoroso finish, 42%",Single Malt Scotch,92,1300,"a seductive dalmore. very fruity too, with seville orange, peaches in syrup, clementine, pineapple, and bramble. sugared almond, powdered vanilla, ginger, and lush sherry on the finish add depth and dimension. consistent on the nose and palate, and with great balance. i’m glad they stopped the amoroso finishing when they did. i feel that any more sherry influence here would have been counterproductive. very lovely!"
"the dalmore cigar malt reserve, 44%",Single Malt Scotch,92,125,"back due to popular demand in the u.s., this new incarnation of the cigar malt sees the percentage of ex-oloroso ‘matusalem’ sherry wood ramped up from 60 to 70 percent. pass the partagas! spicy christmas cake with rich sherry notes on the nose. fragrant, with figs, cinnamon, ripe oranges, and glacé cherries. robust sweet toffee and mango flavors, with oloroso sherry, vanilla, and lively spices. medium to long in the finish, with ginger, treacle, and licorice. "
"dalmore 35 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,92,5000,"this is comprised of whisky aged in a bourbon barrel, a 30 year old matusalem sherry butt, and a colheita port pipe. figs and malt on the early nose; resinous, with tangerines, vanilla, and soft leather. slightly thin on the palate, but very smooth, with spiced orange, dates, and coffee grounds. dries very slowly in the finish, with persistent orange, a sprinkling of black pepper, and a suggestion of mouth-drying oak. (1,000 bottles per year for five years)"
"dalmore quintessence, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,92,1230,"quintessence is the first single malt to have undergone secondary maturation in five different types of california red wine casks: zinfandel, pinot noir, syrah, merlot, and cabernet sauvignon. sweet sherry, ripe cherries, marzipan, and white pepper on the nose. rich and mouth-coating; strong flavor of thick-cut orange marmalade, oloroso sherry, malt, and milk chocolate. the finish features gentle warming spice and lingering jaffa orange. plain chocolate and orange notes seem as though they are never going to end! £1,000"
"dalmore 40 year old, 42%",Single Malt Scotch,92,"7,500","this was initially matured in american oak bourbon barrels, then spent 7 years in 30 year old matusalem sherry butts before 2 years of finishing in first-fill bourbon casks. the nose yields orange marmalade, wood resin, toasted brioche, and cocktail cherries. apricot fruitiness on the early palate, then vanilla, ginger, and treacle. the finish is medium in length, with orange peel, fennel, and gentle spices.

"edradour port wood finish, 1983 vintage, cask #04/0544, 52.9%",Single Malt Scotch,92,195,"one of the first wood finishing efforts under edradour’s new management. very creamy in texture, with notes of sticky toffee, vanilla fudge, fruit cake, raisin, and burnt almonds. all this sits on a bed of dry, minty, resinous oak. the flavors dovetail nicely, with a soothing, satisfying finish. the port wood finishing adds complexity without dominating.

"duncan taylor (distilled at glen grant), cask #3480, 37 year old, 51.5%",Single Malt Scotch,92,336,"i am amazed by how many old, sherried glen grant whiskies have been released to the market in the past ten years. (did the distillery owners at the time also own sherry bodegas, or what?) anyway, some of these have been dark, decadent, and delicious, and i’ll put this whisky in that category. chestnut colored, with lush fruit, treacle, dark chocolate, leather, tobacco, roasted walnuts, and cherry cough syrup. a complex, well-structured whisky. 
"
"gordon & macphail (distilled at glen grant) 60 year old, 42.3%",Single Malt Scotch,92,12000,"rich gold. superb mature nose with subtle whisky rancio, mixing fragrant mango with a little mint, rosewater, and waxiness; there’s even some custard and a whiff of woodsmoke before sandalwood brings back the exotic edge. the palate is delicate with an amazingly fresh acidity that becomes herbal (basil and tarragon). it’s late summer, when there’s a sense of the year turning, and you allow fond memories to gently wash over you. £7,800"
"glenfarclas family casks 1988 cask #434, 53.4%",Single Malt Scotch,92,580,"quite earthy, with orris root, burlap, and dunnage warehouse notes.  distinctly meaty—bovril (beef stock)—then cedary. this untamed edge—think mortlach or benrinnes—dominates the palate, but the cask (a refill butt) isn’t overstating its presence. there’s espresso on the finish. here’s glenfarclas taking a ramble on the wild side. if your preference is for more robust styles, then look no further. £345"
"glenfiddich, 50 year old, 46.1%",Single Malt Scotch,92,16000,"we’re drinking liquid history here. antique gold color. aromas of dried citrus, lemongrass, and ginger with background honeyed vanilla, dried herb, bouquet of roses, and a wisp of smoke. very long and evolving on the palate, going from sweet to dry: vanilla custard, crème brulee, white chocolate, candied citrus, juicy oak, polished leather, dried tobacco, and then resinous oak, with teasing dry roasted nuts and hint of peat bog throughout. long dry, resinous finish. remarkably well-maintained for its age. i can tell that it’s an old whisky, but it shows good complexity. it’s not tired and excessively oaked. 
when compared to the 30 year old and 40 year old expressions, it’s actually more vibrant and youthful than the 40 sample i have. yet it doesn’t have the deft balance and roundness which i consider a hallmark of the 30. bottom line here: anyone who can afford this whisky and actually drinks it will not be disappointed. it’s really nice. but for us regular folk, try to pick up a 30 year old glenfiddich if you can find one and you won’t go wrong with the whisky -- or the price (relatively speaking, that is)."
"glenfiddich rare oak 25 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,92,383,"a classic mature ‘fiddich nose, that mix of chocolate, sweet fruits, and funkiness. dried apples, a little currant, but also a pure thread of sweetness. in time, a little fresh mushroom. complex. soft on the tongue, so you need to concentrate on what’s happening. later becomes minty, with supple tannins and a little artichoke on the finish. water needs to be handled carefully to bring out green herbal notes. i’d probably keep water on the side. excellent.

"glen garioch the renaissance 3rd chapter 17 year old, 50.8%",Single Malt Scotch,92,135,"the renaissance began with a 15 year old expression and charts the same spirit as it continues to mature. aged in bourbon and sherry casks, the 3rd chapter exhibits a sweet and sophisticated nose of honey, milk chocolate, brazil nuts, toffee, and ripe peaches. supple on the palate, with luscious orange and peach notes, vanilla, oak, and subtle spice. plain chocolate-coated orange confectionery in the finish, with caramel and ginger. balanced and delicious! £100"
"glenglassaugh 37 year old, 56%",Single Malt Scotch,92,600,"a first-fill sherry cask bottling (one cask, exclusive to north america). some of the old glenglassaugh whiskies can be very delicious, and this is one of them. it's very clean, lush, and fruity (bramble, citrus, golden raisin), with a kiss of honey, toffee, and soft spice. elegantly sherried; it’s never cloying. a very nice whisky from a quality cask that tastes more like 21 or 25 years old than 37. (i mean this in a good way.) "
"glengoyne 35 year old, 46.8%",Single Malt Scotch,92,4640,"glengoyne 35 year old has been aged in sherry casks and just 500 decanters have been released. the nose offers sweet sherry, maraschino cherries, honey, sponge cake, marzipan, and soft fudge, turning to caramel in time, with a whiff of worn leather. slick in the mouth, with spicy dried fruit, and more marzipan and cherries. long in the finish with plain chocolate cherry liqueur; still spicy. finally a buttery, bourbon-like note. no negative cask connotations in this well-balanced after-dinner dram."

"
"the glenlivet founder’s reserve, 55.6%",Single Malt Scotch,92,375,"a special bottling to celebrate a major distillery expansion in 2010. so nice to see this whisky bottled at cask strength and not chill-filtered. silky smooth, velvety texture. creamy sweet foundation of vanilla fudge and caramel-coated almond. plenty of fruit, too (golden raisin, honeyed peach, ripe nectarine, hint of banana bread). richly textured, good weight (but not cloying), and the flavors combine seamlessly. a celebratory whisky indeed."

first-fill sherry wood makes a return here and adds its own rich dried fruitiness — think sultana cake — to the exotic whisky rancio notes of cheese rind, sealing wax, and roasting pheasant. as it opens, there’s fig, some peat smoke, black cherry, and concentrated stone fruits. this exotic/savory/sweet interplay continues on the tongue where there’s a surprising hint of mint and some pear blossom. the finish is long, with apple skin, gingerbread, and walnut. a discreet nod to cognac. £1,250 "
"glenlivet 21 year old archive, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,92,220,"this expression is reputed to contain some whisky up to 40 years old and was matured in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. the nose offers overt sherry influences, with fruit malt loaf, maple syrup, honey, and old leather. full and slightly oily on the rich palate, with toffee, raisins, brazil nuts, and fresh cake mix. dusty spices and oak in the relatively dry finish."

"glenrothes 32 year old, 1972 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,92,160,"a very richly textured glenrothes. a heavy, honeyed maltiness provides the foundation of this whisky, with interwoven candied fruit notes (orange, tangerine, sultana), red and black licorice, toffee, and toasted almonds. dry, spicy, oak notes balance its sweetness and provide depth. what impresses me most about this whisky is how it evolves on the palate and continues evolving through its lengthy finish. 
"
"signatory (distilled at glenrothes), 30 year old, 1973, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,92,220,"glenrothes is one of those speyside whiskies which matures very gracefully. recent distillery bottlings (i.e. the 1979 and 1972 vintages) prove this point. this signatory bottling also demonstrates that glenrothes has the ability to get older and better. in this offering, the palate-coating, sticky caramel, syrupy maltiness of the whisky is rescued by firm, bold dry oak spice and lush fruit. delicious toffee and roasted nuts longer on the finish. the 30 years in oak gives this whisky great depth, and bottling the whisky at natural cask strength ensures that the whisky is not cut off at the knees. a soothing post-prandial affair. 
"
"glenrothes vintage 1988 2nd edition, 44.1%",Single Malt Scotch,92,485,"matured in a mixture of first-fill american sherry hogsheads and refill sherry butts, this is rich and fragrant on the nose, with dark berries and marzipan, then glacé cherries and wood polish. the palate is voluptuous with spicy dark fruit, christmas cake, vanilla, milk chocolate, and a hint of dark rum. dried fruits in the finish, with raisins, aniseed, and soft oak. finally, plain chocolate. superb! £375"
"the glenturret jamieson's jigger edition, 43.1%",Single Malt Scotch,92,382,"at 29 years old this single cask is one of the best releases to date from the perthshire distillery. the nose offers geraniums, honey, almonds, and toasted brioche, while the palate is creamy with vanilla, heather, a fresh menthol note, and green apples. long and nutty in the finish, with black pepper. drying only slightly, and spicy to the end—predominantly ginger. beautifully balanced. (170 bottles) £295"
"highland park, cask #8998, 1974 vintage, 31 year old, 45.4%",Single Malt Scotch,92,438,"antique gold, relatively light in color compared to the rest of the highland parks reviewed here. nicely rounded on the nose and palate, and surprisingly youthful for such maturity. mouth-coating texture. quite fruity -- especially with some water -- with notes of honey-drenched citrus, sultana, key lime pie, and melon. caramel and bitter chocolate notes emerge, with the chocolate and a wisp of smoke lingering on the finish. i could drink this all day and never tire of it. (bottled for virginia abc)"
"highland park 'hjarta', 12 years old, 58.1%",Single Malt Scotch,92,106,"rich, deep, and muscular on the nose and palate -- and very polished. notes of caramel/butterscotch-coated citrus (lemon, clementine) honeyed tropical fruit (coconut, pineapple), peaches and cream, creamy vanilla, and ripe barley, along with more subtle smoke, cut grass, and ginger. firm, dry, resinous grip on the finish keeps all the sweetness in check. rather expensive for its age, but not for its quality. very impressive for a 12 year old! (available only at the highland park distillery, their on-line shop, and in scandinavia.)£65"
"highland park, “saint magnus,” 55%",Single Malt Scotch,92,132,"the second in a series of three high-strength, limited edition highland park whiskies, and a rather bold expression. nicely sherried and noticeably smoky — more than a standard highland park. quite spicy too — with cinnamon, but also ginger and nutmeg. throw in some toffee apple, cointreau, and waxed fruit for intrigue. long, sherried, smoky finish. a very exciting whisky. (not available in the u.s.)£85"
"highland park 1971 vintage, 46.7%",Single Malt Scotch,92,3700,"one of two recent vintage releases, this 1971 example has been matured in seventeen spanish oak casks, that yielded a total of 657 bottles. sweet on the nose, with maple syrup, almonds, and sherry. soft and insinuating. becoming progressively smokier. bold fruit and peat notes on the palate, plus oak, cloves, and dark chocolate notes. peppery in the long finish, with subtle tannins and persistent citrus fruits. "
"highland park the dark 17 year old, 52.9%",Single Malt Scotch,92,300,"matured exclusively in sherry-seasoned first-fill european oak casks and bottled at cask strength. the nose yields figs, soft smoke, cinnamon, sugarcane, and rich fruitcake. the palate is succulent and confident, with creamy sweet sherry, dried fruits, coffee, and woodsmoke. long and drying in the finish, with flecks of char. highland park doing what it does best. (28,000 bottles)"
"lagavulin 16 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,92,90,"lagavulin is a classic example of how smoke isn’t a blunt instrument that covers everything in a fog, but an element that works with all the flavors produced in distillation and maturation. lagavulin isn’t ‘smoky,’ its peat moves into a weird territory of lapsang souchong tea and pipe tobacco, fishboxes and kippers. it smells of laurel and light cereal, but is always sweet. the palate shows more creosote, with hints of kelp and a little touch of iodine. complex."
"lagavulin 21 year old special release 2012, 52%",Single Malt Scotch,92,624,"lagavulin from a first-fill sherry butt? there’s unusual. this is huge, fluxing, and complex, mixing saddles and dark chocolate, pu-erh tea and smothered kiln, geranium and velvet, gamey venison and treacle. the smoke is integrated, the fires ember-like, the oak there but not oppressively so. massive, dense, layered, and complex, this needs time to open. in short, a distillation of islay and up alongside last year’s jazz festival bottling."
"lagavulin feis ile 2013 bottling (distilled 1995), 51%",Single Malt Scotch,92,152,"though quiet to start, the impression is of a fog of smoke, balled up within a dunnage
warehouse, ready to erupt to add itself to the cool spearmint and oxidized
nuttiness. the palate is where it shows its class: mature, slowly unfolding and
layered, with latakia tobacco, menthol, nori, white pepper, pear, and a massive,
tarry bohea souchong tea element on the finish. everything from lagavulin is
touched with gold at the moment. try to find a bottle. (distillery only) £99"
"laphroaig original cask, 10 year old, 57.3%",Single Malt Scotch,92,60,"amber with gold streaks. its aroma and flavor is fresh, powerful, and medicinal, with notes of peat smoke, band-aids, tar, rich toffee, seaweed, and brine. thick in body, with an almost molasses-like viscosity. 
"
"the exclusive malts (distilled at laphroaig) cask #10866 22 year old 1990, 47.1%",Single Malt Scotch,92,250,"clean and complex, showing a matured, somewhat restrained personality for laphroaig: less medicinal, but more rounded. tar,
pencil shavings, anise, honeyed citrus, spanish olive brine, and a hint of seaweed and white pepper on a bed of creamy vanilla, caramel, and light nougat. lingering, satisfying finish. frustrated by a dearth of 20-plus year old distillery-bottled laphroaigs? look no further. delicious!"
"signatory (distilled at laphroaig) 1998, 60.8%",Single Malt Scotch,92,166,"any sherried laphroaig is welcome, and this does not disappoint. rich, resinous, medicinal, with underlying soft fruits, the smoke is all-pervading, but never dominant. in other words, it isn’t just complex and balanced, but has that other dimension which elevates it in mind (and marks). with water, there’s antiseptic cream mingling with oxidized fruits and nuts; think manzanilla pasada. the palate shows storm clouds gathering over texa. rich dried fruits, cacao, and a ferny lift on the finish. fantastic. (the whisky exchange only)  £100"
"murray mcdavid (distilled at linkwood) 1973, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,92,150,"style: speyside single malt scotch color: honey gold aroma: subtly complex. floral (especially roses). honeyed vanilla sweetness. subtle notes of bourbon and bakers chocolate. murray mcdavid (distilled at linkwood, 1973, 46%) cont. palate: nicely balanced and with great depth. again the honey and vanilla, which marries beautifully with the floral, herbal, subtly fruity notes. almonds and dried spice on the finish. 
"
"adelphi (distilled at linkwood) 1984 26 year old, 57.6%",Single Malt Scotch,92,148,"there are light oaked notes to start, along with oolong tea and very subtle smoke. these then shift into a mix of cedar and scented blossom. classic, layered elegance with the cask offering support, not dominance. the fruits have that slightly eerie quality of decay, while the palate is deep and juicy. this is an exemplary, subtle, old whisky with delicate rancio (it’s a little cognac-like), which is given a boost of extra life with a small drop of water. £94"
"longrow 18 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,92,220,"this limited release was matured in 60% refill sherry butts and 40% fresh bourbon barrels. initially sweet vanilla and ripe apple notes on the nose, giving way to chimney soot and dry peat. the palate is very full and oily, with honey and vanilla merging with smoked haddock, charcuterie, and more overt peat. licorice, coffee beans, brine, chili, and peppery peat in the lengthy finish. (4,500 bottles)"
"exclusive malts (distilled at longmorn) 28 year old, 51.6%",Single Malt Scotch,92,250,"the nose is fascinating, as if dust is cohering into form, and fruity form at that. when it emerges there’s baked banana, fruitcake, citrus peels, passion fruit, mango, mace flower, and nutmeg. a mossy edge anchors it to earth. even livelier with water, this is a superbly balanced, mature whisky. the palate is pure, with big retronasal impact of the spice. layered and long, it’s at its best neat; you need the intensity to amplify all the complexity. superb."
"the macallan, 15 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,92,52,"solid amber color. flavors are seamless, silky smooth, and rich, with notes of dried fruit and flowers, toffee, subtle spices, and delicate nuts. a great after dinner malt, but universal enough to drink anytime. 
"
"the macallan, 1961 vintage, 54.1%",Single Malt Scotch,92,1000,"deep amber color. complex aromas of lush fruit (orange, lemon, red currant) and oak spices (cinnamon, clove, and licorice). rich, silky body. great balance and depth of flavor, with complex fruit and wood spices similar to its aroma all wrapped in toffee and vanilla fudge. very long, evolving, and satisfying finish. 
"
"the macallan cask strength, 58.6%",Single Malt Scotch,92,60,"deep amber color with crimson hues. incredibly rich aromas of fruitcake, toffee, dates, roasted nuts, with a hint of cocoa powder and other spices. rich and thick in body. on the palate, there are evolving notes of chewy toffee, ripe fruit (oranges, golden raisons), chocolate covered nuts, multigrain toast, and polished oak. long, soothing finish. 
"
"the macallan fine oak, 15 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,92,65,"this is my favorite of the three. for about $20 more, you get a richer, much more complex whisky than the 10 year old, and it is more balanced than the 21 year old. this 15 is drier than the 10, with lovely floral and spice notes (cinnamon, coriander, dried orange peel, lavender, rose), balanced by honey-laced complex fruit, and a dry, dark chocolate/orange marmalade finish 
"
"macallan royal wedding, 46.8%",Single Malt Scotch,92,240,"rising above the tat issued to celebrate the nuptials of prince william and kate middleton was this extremely limited (1,000 bottles) release from the macallan. the nose is a mélange of rich fruits, marzipan, and beeswax/resin but it lifts with a drop of water to show apricot and heavy florals. the palate isn’t overly grippy, with more orange peel, almond, and characteristic oiliness. a malty/nutty smooth finish makes this a great one. £150 (not available in the u.s.)"
"macallan 18 year old sherry oak 2017 edition, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,92,294,"the latest annual limited release is classic and sure to please true aficionados of macallan. stewed fruit and old leather on the nose, along with ripe cherries, gingersnaps, and black pepper, before orange marmalade notes develop. full-bodied, with fragrant sweet orange, milk chocolate-coated turkish delight, and faint smoke. the finish yields dark chocolate, cherry liqueur, and more pepper. long and spicy."
"gordon & macphail (distilled at mortlach), 36 year old, 1970 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,92,250,"deep amber, mahogany color. very mature and well-balanced. notes of maple syrup on pancakes, roasted chestnuts, dates, pot still rum, burnished leather, maduro tobacco, and subtle moroccan spice. soft, stately finish. older whiskies often show an exotic side to their personalities as they mellow out with age, especially if the wood influence doesn’t dominate. this is a very nice example of the genre. 
"
"port ellen 32 year old (11th release) special releases 2011, 53.9%",Single Malt Scotch,92,488,"port ellen’s make was usually filled into old casks to maximize its smoke when used young. to us, therefore, it’s islay’s most austere malt, yet the guys who worked there all talk of its sweetness. here, finally, is an example of that. yes, there’s some wet slate and briny smoke, but it’s balanced by citrus, waxy fruits, and a central sweetness adding complexity. it might have taken a long time to get here, but it was worth the wait. (editor's choice)   "
"d&m (distilled at scapa), 19 year old, 1989 vintage, 52.7%",Single Malt Scotch,92,150,"this single cask bottling of scapa is a beauty! brilliant gold color. clean and fresh on the nose and palate, with complex bright fruit (peach, tangerine, golden delicious apple, honeydew melon, pineapple), spice (cinnamon, vanilla, subtle cocoa), appetizing brine, and beach pebbles, all on a bed of creamy, squeaky-clean honeyed malt. dynamic, appetizing, briny, dried spice finish. a delicious, superbly balanced whisky that makes a great aperitif, but i could drink this any time. (bottled exclusively for d&m aficionado’s club.)"
"chieftain’s (distilled at springbank), 40 year old, 54%",Single Malt Scotch,92,1400,"aged in a first-fill sherry butt. soft sherry notes, gentle toffee, golden raisin, green tea with honey, a peppering of spice (cinnamon, red and black licorice, candied ginger, hint of coconut macaroon and brine) and undertones of juicy oak (especially on the finish). tame, somewhat seductive, and well-rounded. not overly oaked, and i’m not finding any off notes. a lovely whisky, but not quite as dynamic as the “classic” springbanks i’ve tasted from the 60s."
"springbank 15 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,92,130,"the nose is complex, with almonds, coconut, soft leather, tropical fruits, and stewed black tea. hints of brine and peat appear. the palate is rounded and rich, with more tropical fruits, sherry, caramel, pipe tobacco, wood smoke, and spicy tannins. the finish is relatively long and creamy, with lingering smokiness. all the classic springbank elements merge nicely here."
"duncan taylor (distilled at strathisla), 36 year old, 1967 vintage, 42.5%",Single Malt Scotch,92,160,"this whisky starts out rich and lush-both in aroma and on the palate, with notes of fig cake, candied fruit, and sticky toffee pudding. citrus fruit (orange, lemon, tangerine)-a characteristic that emerges with many older whiskies-cuts through the heft and lushness of this whisky, contributing complexity, balance and drinkability. the whisky continues to evolve, serving up notes of almonds, exotic spice, and polished leather on the finish. an excellent example of what a mature, speyside whisky should taste like. 
"
"gordon & macphail (distilled at strathisla), 1963, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,92,275,"some of these old g&m strathisla whiskies are quite lovely, and this is one of them. it’s gently sherried, soothingly oily in texture, and complex, with notes of maple syrup, candied fruit, plum, roasted nuts, polished leather, and old oak, along with some damp earth, coffee bean, cinnamon, mint, and subtle, teasing kiln smoke. it’s soft, rounded, and still holds up nicely for a 44 year old whisky. if you like old, sherried speysiders that aren’t overly oaked or sherried, you’ll like this one. if only it was bottled at 43% or 46% (or at natural cask strength, if it was less than 43%). it would give the whisky a little more backbone, and i might have bumped my rating up to the mid-90s. 
"
"lonach (distilled at strathisla), 42 year old, 41.1%",Single Malt Scotch,92,205,"i wish the owners of strathisla would put out older expressions of their whisky, and here’s why. layers of sweetness (caramel in particular, but also honey and toffee) dovetail beautifully with an array of lush fruit (orange, apricot, golden raisin, fruit gumdrops). all this is underpinned by subtle dried spice (cinnamon, cool mint, nutmeg) and teasing oak resin on the finish. what’s most impressive here isn’t the laundry list of flavors (although they certainly are there), but rather the balance. this, and its lovely depth, with no signs of lethargy. impressive!
"
"talisker, 25 year old (2009 release), 54.8%",Single Malt Scotch,92,200,"comes across initially to me as reserved, perhaps even elegant for a talisker. soothing too, with an oily texture. quite fruity (orange, tangerine, apricot), perhaps even floral, with a delicate pastry sweetness. then the more traditional talisker notes kick in -- brine, seaweed, warming pepper -- repeated in the finish. a high-quality talisker; albeit a bit reserved at times. i love the oily, viscous texture."
"talisker 35 year old special release 2012, 54.6%",Single Malt Scotch,92,850,"talisker is a special releases favorite, and this bottling, the oldest ever marketed by the distillery, is actually the sixteenth. distillation was in 1977, and maturation has taken place in both american and european oak refill casks. soft wood smoke, sultana, nutmeg, and chili powder on the nose. dried fruits, vanilla, and malt merge with more chili and savory notes, plus newly-dug soil on the complex palate. a touch of brine, orange peel, and bonfire in the finish. 3,090 bottles. "
"talisker 1985, 56.1%",Single Malt Scotch,92,600,"this 27 year old talisker has been aged in refill american oak casks, and the nose offers brine, wood smoke, wet tarry rope, slightly medicinal, with the emergence of milk chocolate. big-bodied, with lots of peat accompanied by chili and smoked bacon, with sweeter notes of malt, fudge, and apple. a hint of fabric elastoplast. long in the finish, with rock pools, bonfire ash, and sweet, tingling spice notes which carry to the very end. a powerful beast, even by talisker standards. (3,000 bottles)."
"tamdhu batch strength no. 002, 58.5%",Single Malt Scotch,92,90,"the first batch strength expression of tamdhu appeared in 2015 and was also matured entirely in sherry casks and not chill filtered. big, sweet sherry notes on the nose, with vanilla, sultanas, maraschino cherries, and turkish delight. rich and full-bodied, with oloroso sherry, milk chocolate, vanilla, dates, ripe cherries, sweet oak, and allspice. the finish is sweet and long, with lingering, lively spices. a very quaffable, well-priced dram for sherry bomb lovers."
"gordon & macphail (distilled at tomintoul), cask #644, 1967 vintage, 40 year old, 49.4%",Single Malt Scotch,92,260,"a deep, mature tomintoul that manages to retain the elegance and drinkability found in younger tomintoul whiskies. roasted nuts, lush fruit, suggestions of cherry brandy and orange marmalade layered with rich fudge, toffee, and maple syrup. soothing finish. tomintoul can be a simple whisky at a younger age, but this one has matured into a beautifully complex dram. (bottled for park avenue liquors.) 
"
"tomintoul reserve 37 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,92,600,"not what you’d expect from a malt at this age. instead of oak dominating the nose, it's citrus in focus, with orange marmalade, candied orange, and even orange blossom. on the palate this whisky is light and delicate, leading with the citrus notes from the nose. this symphony of orange is followed with toffee, ginger, oak, and rancio in a combination that's well balanced and integrated. unique for its age, a definite treat for those who prefer lighter and more delicate whiskies. (u.s. only, 600 bottles)"
"tomatin, 1973 vintage (cask #25602), 44%",Single Malt Scotch,92,730,"aged in a refill american oak cask. quite lively for its age, and the oak (surprisingly and happily) plays a supporting role rather than dominating. creamy and mouth-coating, with vanilla wafer, coconut cream pie, caramel, nougat, and bright fruit (sultana, apricot, tangerine, and pineapple in syrup). soothing finish. a very nice whisky. (not available in the u.s.)£450"
"tomatin 1971 warehouse 6 collection, 45.8%",Single Malt Scotch,92,4000,"this 44 year old was matured in oloroso casks before being bottled at cask strength in may 2016. mellow, sherried fruit on the nose, with rose hips, vanilla fudge, almond, honey, and slightly earthy spices. the fragrant palate features an intense blast of ripe fruit, caramel, and sweet spices, while resin develops in time. the medium-length finish offers plain chocolate, raisins, and prunes, with no negative tannins. one of the best tomatins to date."
"oban little bay, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,92,75,"finally, an unimpeachable counterpoint to the rally cry against no age statement whisky. oban little bay is everything that oban 14 is, and more. a rich, fruity, malty nose showcases dried apricot, dark chocolate, and salt. on the palate, little bay explodes with flavor, combining malt with orange, chocolate, and blackberry. clove and oak spice join the party in the mid-palate, which shows superb balance and integration. a long, slightly dry, citrusy spice finish caps off a stunning whisky."
"black bull, 40 year old, 40.2%",Blended Scotch Whisky,92,250,"a whopping 90% malt and 10% grain whisky. soft, with the oak remarkably restrained for its age. soothingly sweet, with toffee apple, vanilla-spiked sponge cake, nougat, butterscotch, sultana, and cut grass. a dash of cinnamon and coconut throughout, with teasing, gentle polished oak on the finish. deftly balanced and oh, so drinkable. "
"sheep dip 'old hebridean,' 1990 vintage, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,70,"a marriage of dalmore, fettercairn, and ardbeg, and their personalities certainly show. the whisky was blended and then aged for an additional 15 years -- very atypical. the marriage of the three really works very well, combining a rich sweetness (honeyed malt, toffee) with spice, brine, vanilla, bitter chocolate, charcoal, espresso, tobacco, cigar ash, subtle marmalade, and firm -- but not dominating -- leafy peat smoke. thick, nicely-textured body, too. lingering brine and smoke on the finish. delicious as it is, i can only imagine what it would be like bottled at 46% and not chill-filtered. (i probably would be bumping it up a few points.)"
"kilchoman 'inaugural release,' 46%",Single Malt Scotch,92,60,"aged 2.5 to 3 years on bourbon casks and then finished in sherry casks for 6 months. wow, this is quite stunning! old-fashioned in many respects: oily texture, with rooty, layered peat smoke, coal tar, shoe polish, and hints of wet sheep as the foundation for a complex array of additional flavors: toffee apple, caramel fudge, blackberry jam, golden raisin, grist, bourbon barrel char, and licorice root. long, smoldering ember, dried herb, light toffee finish. it’s all balanced perfectly, and very mature for its age. if you like smoky whiskies, track one down. (not available in the u.s.) £37.00"
"glen moray mastery, 52.3%",Single Malt Scotch,92,1000,"glen moray is celebrating its 120th anniversary with mastery, a vatting from 1978, 1988, 1994, 1999, and 2001. maturation—and finishing—has occurred in a mix of bourbon, sherry, madeira, and port casks. resinous sherry, smoky red wine, caramel, and vanilla on the nose. voluptuous on the palate, with sherry, succulent stewed fruit, soft toffee, and cocoa powder. long in the gently spiced finish, with port-soaked oak. (1,000 bottles)"
"mackinlay’s rare old highland whisky, 47.3%",Blended Scotch Whisky,92,162,"rarely has a blend caused as much excitement as this one, but with good reason. this is also known as the shackleton whisky, and is a recreation of the whisky abandoned in the antarctic by explorer ernest shackleton more than 100 years ago. it has lemon, spring blossom, and wafts of smoke on the nose. the taste is full and citrusy, with peat and pepper in attendance. beautifully balanced and outstanding, but there are just 50,000 bottles, so snap it up."
"ballantine’s 21 year old signature oak edition, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,92,140,"sandy hyslop has excelled at solely blending european oak sherry cask whiskies here. a dry, spicy nose to relish: rum-raisin ice cream, wafer biscuits, fennel seeds, roasted coriander, seasoned oak, and dense fruitcake. after the cinnamon toast crunch and toffee sweetness disrobe, a riot of spices cavorts across the tastebuds, bedding down to a flavor of spiced, chocolate-covered toffee bars. for cigar lovers, this demands a fine, robust smoke. (travel retail exclusive)"
"blue hanger 4th release berry bros. & rudd, 45.6%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,75,"this blue hanger has sherry and fruit on the nose, but it's all reined in. then the palate is big, rich, complex, and fruity, and late oakiness from some 30 year-plus malt in the mix brings the perfect finale. £61"
"blue hanger 7th release limited edition, 45.6%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,100,"what a success story. after six releases in a decade, there have been three just this year. this release is especially for the states, and it's a fireball. there are dried fruits and dusty bookshelves on the nose, and tropical fruits with water. on the palate it's a big, peaty, rich whisky with licorice and more of the pineapple, kiwifruit, and guava. you get the whole fairground in the finale, with candy, fruit, and smoke. excellent."
"blue hanger 11th limited release, 45.6%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,137,"it’s the intensity of flavor that just grabbed me by the lapels and spun me round. it harbors intense tangelo juiciness; that unparalleled concentration of deep citrus skillfully mingled with dark vanilla, dried apricots, and gentle smoke. this goes the distance, delivering wave after delicious wave: peach juice, mandarin, pineapple cubes, and lemon zest. a firm, unctuous finish shows a little charred wood and dark sugar cloaked in fine smoke. tongue pleasing and very special indeed. £90"
"big peat small batch, 53.6%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,48,"the original big peat was a mix of smoky islay malts and was already up there with the very best competition in the category, even though many of the others were bottled at cask strength. i scored it at 90. now it’s back to play in the big boys' pool with a killer cask strength whisky of its own. this is to whisky what ac/dc is to heavy rock: old school, predictable, but great and exactly what fans want."
"big peat christmas edition 2015, 53.8%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,70,"marginally less aggressive than in 2014, this big peat is more rounded and exhibits greater finesse. overall, it’s a better whisky. the invasive smoke still infiltrates the skull and clasps your brain tightly. a sweet smoke of smoldering hillside wildfire extinguished by rubber beaters, balanced by meadow flowers, tree blossom, and honey. sticky lemons smeared in thick honey, cracked black pepper, and a fabulous, almost gelatinous texture, it builds solidly in peaty intensity. knockout! a hot, smoky finish like dragon’s breath."
"william grant rare cask reserves ghosted reserve 21 year old, 42.8%",Blended Scotch Whisky,92,140,"a purity and fragility rarely encountered, with aromas as fleeting as footprints on wet sand: marshmallow, meringue, honey, and rose petals. a delicacy to the structure brings banana, caramel, spun sugar, and orange peel. the oak spices build slowly, making the lips throb from the inside. it’s an elaborate maze of ethereal suggestion and an apparition of calm beauty. it atrophies reluctantly, leaving tangy peels and lengthy sweetness anchored by spicy base notes. (12,000 bottles)"
"douglas laing old particular (distilled at cambus) 25 year old 1991, 62%",Single Grain Whisky,92,80,"a single cask from a refill hoggie, this bursts with vanilla fudge, cracked peppercorn, wood shavings, and apple strudel. incredibly fruity, with mouth-watering gummy bears, tangy orange, and dried pineapple, evolving from sweet fruits through to banana chews. diluting down from its considerable cask strength only pumps up the juiciness. to conclude, a long, creamy finish like a banana shake. evidently, terrific cask selection at work. (k&l wines exclusive, 246 bottles)"
"exclusive blend 1991 21 year old, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,100,"from whisky connoisseur david stirk's exclusive malts single cask cask strength range, this is a blend made with 80% malt, and it shows. this is a beauty. it's also a ‘traffic light’ whisky, with the sort of whisky rancio associated with the oldest whiskies up front, peaches and cream and pureed fruit in the center, and changing to oaky spiciness late on. whisky with body, depth, and balance, which morph seamlessly. very good indeed."
"exclusive malts (distilled at cameronbridge) 1984 33 year old, 51.2%",Single Grain Whisky,92,225,"top notes of hay, honey, and caramel over a spicy core pulsating with pepper, rye, spiced quaker oats, and freshly planed wood. an epic battle ensues: round after round of citrus vs. spice, both growing stronger as they slug it out; jabs of sweetness meet a chastisingly nippy right hook, until, eventually exhausted, both protagonists drop their guard. dry crackling spice and sugared almonds run through a mighty long finish."
"the feathery, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,92,66,"chocolate-covered raisins scoffed on a heathery moor, leather riding tack, intense plain chocolate, malt loaf, mixed nuts, medjool dates, and traces of wood ash. a gorgeous, unctuous mouthfeel with flavors spun around bright sparks of orange, dark toffee, and rich maltiness, melding to black cherry, stewed fruits, licorice, and charred oak. named for the leather golf balls packed with goose feathers used in the early 19th century. sink one for a birdie. from the bottlers of sheep dip. £39"
"the sovereign (distilled at cambus) 30 year old 1984, 49.4%",Single Grain Whisky,92,152,"the nose is bathed in aromas of lime, bergamot, lychee, and fresh pineapple cores. this is delicate, refined, and complex, with touches of fragrant spices and a calming influence of oak. a web of citrus strands, barley sugar, and toffee is shot through by wood spices and surpassed by a delicious butterscotch flavor that continues into the finish.  effortless, relaxed, and brilliant whisky, and quite frankly, i’m not sure you could find better 30 year old whisky at this price. £106"
"duncan taylor rare auld (distilled at girvan) 1974 40 year old, 53.7%",Single Grain Whisky,92,450,"this is an assured release, one not trying to be anything other than beautiful old grain whisky. caramel, aged oak, rose petals, and dried heather twigs, with touches of sweetness. the palate has a lovely substantial feel to it, the strength quite apparent, with soft sweet toffees, fleeting citrus and grapefruit, then aniseed tugging at your tongue. the finish is a gum-numbing, sweet decay of fading oaky memories. (78 bottles)"
"the five distinguished and rare 39 year old, 51%",Single Grain Whisky,92,216,"this is massive. it even pours thickly, as the aromas spill out of the glass: rich stewed apple, dry oak, a passing digestif trolley wobbling with dark sticky bottles, and currants on the tummy of a gingerbread man. there is a rum-like quality to the thick texture that lands squarely on the palate, bursting out with sweet apple and brown sugar. it hardly loses its grip after swallowing, dissipating almost imperceptibly against the approaching oak flavors. special indeed. (330 bottles, woodwinters wines & whiskies only) £150"
"pure scot virgin oak 43, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,92,50,"bladnoch master distiller ian macmillan’s blend is worth seeking out for its appealing freshness; green apple, caramel, shaved oak, toasted whole-grain bread, warm pastries, and dried peels. the palate is awash with bright flavors of honey, walnut, barley sugar, gingerbread in custard, orange taffy candy, and a little spice. it squeezes out more juicy peel oils the more you taste. the conclusion has sweet honey, gingerbread crumbs, and a citrus intensity."
"compass box, canto cask 46, 53.2%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,91,65,"aged in new french oak casks, with long-toasted heads. deliciously creamy, sweet, toasty profile with coconut cream, toasted marshmallow, toffee pudding, and honeyed vanilla. gentle spice notes (especially clove) and hints of fruit dance on the palate. very soothing. (bottled for park avenue liquors.) 
"
"compass box 'lady luck', 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,91,170,"a marriage of two casks of caol ila (25 and 29 years old) and one cask of imperial (14 years old). penetratingly smoky, visceral, rooty, and even mean-tempered at times, ultimately being soothed by creamy vanilla and thick malt. it’s peppered with licorice stick, dark chocolate, campfire charcoal, subtle olive brine, and teasing berried fruit. long, clinging finish. the flavors are nicely integrated and complex. well done! (a limited release.)
"
"compass box 3 year old deluxe, 49.2%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,91,300,"not the pimply youth you might be mistakenly expecting, this tongue-in-cheek release is impishly contemptuous of the regulations challenged by glaser during the transparency debate. lemon bonbon, heavy vanilla scents, beeswax boot polish, and white chocolate are well integrated with peat. the exotic fruits and citrus zest tumbling with golden syrup are knocked sideways by clove and pepper. water provokes more sweet smoke. a dry, spicy, waxy finish remains. (3,282 bottles)"
"compass box spice tree, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,91,65,"the tastiest of their signature range, this boasts a dry oak and spice nose with fudge, rye bread, and banana interwoven with french oak influences of nutmeg, cinnamon, and ground ginger. as the gentle orange, malt, pear, and apple settle down, little spicy explosions of ginger and pepper detonate, leaving an aftermath of spiced malt, coffee cake, milk chocolate, and cocoa. such a wonderful flavor trajectory to behold."
"compass box great king street artist's blend, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,91,45,"after a series of esoteric and expensive releases, compass box has decided to bring it all back to the people with a blend — and how! the journey sets out as we might expect; all sweet vanilla ice cream, stewed pear tart, and peach melba, but then a wave of spice and white pepper provides an unexpected but delightful twist. it’s like spice tree meets hedonism…spiconism if you like."
"john walker & sons private collection 2014 edition, 46.8%",Blended Scotch Whisky,91,840,"smoke begins jim beveridge’s public replication of the annual directors blend concept, built around johnnie walker’s signature characteristics. peat smoke harks back to islay, but there’s wood smoke, tobacco leaf, and malt, with a salty richness behind it. the grain just gives it a lift of extra sweetness. polished, with great structure; red apple, raspberry, and sweet linctus wrap up with a long, smoky finish of cigar stub and peat stores. clear parallels with directors blend 2009, but better. (8,888 decanters released) £500"
"johnnie walker blue label ghost and rare, 46%",Blended Scotch Whisky,91,400,"this is much more muscular than the regular, un-haunted blue label. it delivers a multitude of flavors—butter toffee, sweet smoke, citrus peel, and dry spices—tantalizingly peeling off layer after layer, building a slow crescendo to a peak of spices and bitter citrus. mouth drawing with caramel, apple, pear, and sherbet, a mid-palate of zesty orange and baking spices before topping out with bitter peels, grapefruit, smoke, and sour hard candy."
"dewar's founder's reserve, 18 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,91,80,"available for several years, but now finally making its debut in the u.s. the higher-end dewar’s expressions (dewar’s 12 year old and dewar’s signature) are very good blends. this one is situated smartly between the two. the malt proportion is rich and creamy; the grain whisky is crisp and well-integrated. antique gold color, with notes of butterscotch, vanilla wafer, strawberry rhubarb pie, and citrus drizzled with honey. lovely floral notes in the aroma, along with a pleasing, dried spice finish. i could drink this stuff all day long!"
"dewar’s 30 year old ne plus ultra, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,91,499,"this pedro ximénez-finished blend is the oldest dewar’s expression available. it offers a deliciously deep nose of chocolate-dipped biscuits, dried fruits, and orange peel. the palate includes indulgent rewards of berry fruit, chocolate praline, raspberry, cherry, dried cranberry, and hazelnut. it remains succulent throughout, the sherry fruit keeping the upper hand over the chocolate and batting away the occasional coffee note. a dry finish with nutty chocolate and roasted spice. (global travel retail only)"
"classic cask 23 year old original cask, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,91,160,"this archetypal midnight dram enthralls with aromas of cedar wood humidor, blossom honey, hazelnut, vanilla pod, treacle cake, and maple syrup. dry as leaves, save for some floaty florals. it’s less weighty than some whiskies at this age, with a balanced show of cinnamon, cocoa, berry fruits, dried grapefruit, hard peel, wood spices, dark toffee, and oak. a finish of dark vanilla, oak, spice, and leather make for a fine digestif. (782 bottles)"
"aberlour 18 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,91,100,"there was an aberlour 18 on the market for a spell several years ago, aged in sherry casks, that i really enjoyed. now we have this new 18 year old expression. there are big shoes to fill, and this whisky fills them quite nicely. once again, the sherry is prominent throughout, with its lush fruit, velvety texture, and sweet demeanor. but it’s not cloying or sappy — the sherry blends in nicely with the rest of the flavors. ripe orange, apricot preserve, peach cobbler, chocolate-covered caramel, and toffee, with a sprinkling of cinnamon and cocoa. rich, silky smooth, satisfying finish. very impressive. the aberlour 18 year old’s reputation remains intact!"
"ardbeg ardbog, 52.1%",Single Malt Scotch,91,100,"the follow-up to last year’s ardbeg day, here’s the cult distillery in its funkiest
guise with a nose that’s reminiscent (i’d imagine) of a frontier trading post:
all pitch, furs, and gun oil. some mint hangs around in the background
alongside eucalyptus. this is an earthy, in-your-face ardbeg with a hint of
box-fresh sneakers indicating some youthfulness. the mouth is thick and chewy:
wild mint, oily depths, and the slightly manic energy typical of ardbeg’s young
years. editor's choice."
"ardbeg supernova committee bottling 2014, 55%",Single Malt Scotch,91,160,"pale and slightly flinty to start, with touches of caol lla-style salt-washed rocks, but here there’s sweetness, while the smoke gives it a mezcal-like air; pears and burning wood (hot brake pads), minerality, then green olive and a light medicinal note. with water, sashimi-style cleanliness. the palate is rounded, with real olive oil, peppery sweetness, soot, and white chocolate. a real ‘palate whisky,’ filled with bare-faced bravado.  a great ardbeg."
"ardbeg supernova 2015 release, 54.3%",Single Malt Scotch,91,160,"apparently this is the final supernova release and the ardbeg team has ensured it goes out with all guns blazing. although it seems calm initially—there’s a minty and sweet spicy element to the fore—the smoke begins to push through in the guise of creosote, then sootiness which, in turn, mingles with seaweed aromas. the peat dominates the palate but there is sufficient oiliness to round it out and add layers of smoked fish, and dried grasses. farewell."
"ardbeg dark cove committee edition, 55%",Single Malt Scotch,91,110,"this is the bigger, spicier, and more complex of the pair (see below). a prickly start leads to heavy peat smoke, pink and szechuan peppercorns, vanilla, dark chocolate, angelica, then seaweed. the palate is oily, with a detonation of gunpowdery peat, licorice, smoked eel, and a feral edge that adds grunt. layered and complex."
"ardbeg twenty something, 46.3%",Single Malt Scotch,91,550,"this 23 year old expression was released for the ardbeg committee. it includes whisky matured in sherry and bourbon casks. sweet asphalt, bonfire smoke, lemon sponge drizzled in iodine, and background cinnamon on the nose. succulent, sherried, and chocolate-coated orchard fruits on the oily palate, with vanilla and sweet peat. the peat dries slowly in the finish, with developing licorice, kippers, and peppery oak"
"ardbeg grooves, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,91,110,"the 2018 ardbeg day limited-edition bottling includes a proportion of spirit matured in red wine casks which have been heavily charred, leaving deep grooves in the surface of the oak. fragrant soft smoke, warm leather, and salty red berries on the nose; background charcuterie. the palate offers red berry fruits, vanilla, dense peat smoke, brine, and asphalt. beach bonfires and black pepper in the sweet finish."
"auchentoshan 21 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,91,115,"i feel this is by far the best whisky in the standard auchentoshan portfolio, and it is one of the best auchentoshans ever released. it’s delicious, nicely balanced, and with lovely depth for a lowland whisky. baked muffins, creamy vanilla, honey, and caramel blend nicely with delicate fruit notes (lemon, red current, strawberries). an impeccably balanced whisky. similar to the 10 year old reviewed below, but with greater depth and a drier finish. 
"
"balblair 1995, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,91,80,"the latest balblair release is a 1995 vintage expression, exclusive to global travel retail outlets. matured in second-fill bourbon casks, balblair 1995 is non-chill filtered and naturally colored. initially very fruity on the nose, with peaches and carnations, icing sugar on bonbons, then a faint sprinkling of black pepper. stewed fruits on the early palate, full and confident, with developing spices and brittle toffee. relatively lengthy in the finish, with dark chocolate and soft oak. price is per 1 liter."
"the balvenie single barrel, 15 year old (cask #7266), 47.8%",Single Malt Scotch,91,62,"one of the finest balvenie 15 year olds i’ve tasted. the flavors are clean, well defined, confident, and beautifully balanced. full malty foundation (with some ripe barley thrown in). soft, creamy vanilla, honeycomb, bright fruit (orange, nectarine, lemon peel, hints of pineapple), with emerging dried vanilla, coconut, oak resin, and subtle anise. polished oak finish. it doesn’t have the depth that the classic older balvenies have shown in the past, but what it does have, it has in spades. beautiful! (a julio’s liquors exclusive.)"
"balvenie tun 1509, 47.1%",Single Malt Scotch,91,369,"this newbie from balvenie is the worldwide replacement for the market-specific tun 1401. a larger volume vat (8,000 liters) is now being filled with an equally eclectic mix of casks (42 casks ranging from 1970 to 1992). deep amber; this has substance but being balvenie, it’s gentle: orange blossom/manuka honey edged with spice, marmalade, scented woods, and a little frangipane. the palate shows a supple, rippling power with some apricot, cinnamon, and root ginger. awfully good. £230"
"balvenie portwood 21 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,91,220,"this is the ultimate portwood expression from balvenie and has been finished in 30 year old port pipes. a more vibrant and textured travel retail variant is non-chill filtered and bottled at 47.6%. soft, red grape notes, vanilla, and milk chocolate on the nutty nose. very discreet smoke. rich plum flavors in the mouth, dark berries covered in cream, and spicy honey. the finish is long and elegantly drying."
"balvenie tun 1509 (batch 3), 52.2%",Single Malt Scotch,91,350,"the third batch in this series comprises twelve sherry butts distilled between 1989 and 1992, eleven american oak hogsheads from 1989, and eight refill american oak butts distilled in 1992 and 1993. rich sherry, honey, and malt notes on the nose, with figs and citrus peel. silky on the palate, with jaffa oranges, raisins, ginger, and plain chocolate. licorice, sherry, and spicy oak in the very long finish. (8,850 bottles)"
"adelphi (distilled at benriach) 1977 34 year old, 48.8%",Single Malt Scotch,91,283,"sweet and sherried, with plenty of sugar and toffee, moving into plums and thick chestnut honey. give it time, however, and a haunting note of dried mango and guava emerges, followed by amontillado-style nuttiness and then beeswax polish. all in all, just what you want from a gently-aged benriach. the palate may seem initially grippy, but there’s such a massing of fruits that it copes well. keep neat for maximum impact. superb. £180"
"benromach 1975, 49.9%",Single Malt Scotch,91,1600,"this vintage bottling was distilled during the 1970s and spent 41 years in a refill bourbon hogshead (#3434). spicy on the early nose, with fresh oak. increasingly malty, with ginger and apricot. the palate is rich and full, with jaffa orange, stewed apples, cocoa, and pipe tobacco. plain chocolate and increasingly tannic oak in the finish. ultimately, warming spicy citrus fruits and smoky black pepper.

   style: islay single malt scotch whisky. price: approx. $160. available at specialty retailers nationwide. 
   this is a new bottling of bowmore 25 year old and an improved one at that. it is richer, fuller, and more balanced than its predecessor. a wonderful dram indeed. the 17 year old was my favorite of the standard bowmore line. not anymore."
"bowmore, 18 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,91,85,"this replaces the 17 year old in the standard bowmore portfolio. (the 17 year old will now be duty free only.) the difference is significant. this one is more sherried than the 17 year old, and it wears the sherry well. i know that many of you, like myself, adore the 17 year old. indeed, i feel that the 17 year old displays the true essence of bowmore. but this 18 year old integrates the sherry notes with the bowmore signature to create a richly flavored islay whisky experience. thick toffee, ripe fruit, and tar-tinged smoke are accentuated by dark chocolate, cocoa powder, burnt raisin, dates, and sea salt. long, entertaining finish. 
"
"duncan taylor (distilled at bowmore), cask #85013, 22 year, 1982 vintage, 58.9%",Single Malt Scotch,91,100,"a very clean, elegant bowmore with a naked beauty that shows its islay roots. you’ll find fresh brine and seaweed on a bed of honeyed malt and soft vanilla cream. subtle berries, citrus, and melon fruit add a complex fruit dimension. fresh, appetizing finish. nicely done! (exclusive to the party source.)"
"bowmore vault edition atlantic sea salt (first release), 51.5%",Single Malt Scotch,91,140,"this is the first of four bottlings in the vault edition series and was matured in bourbon barrels in the distillery’s famous no.1 vaults. nectarines in brine on the nose, with iodine and sweet spices. medium-bodied on the palate, with peaches, vanilla, salt, and slightly bitter orange. lingering orange notes in the finish, with cocoa powder and lots of salt. this expression lives up to its name!"
"brora, 25 year old, 56.3%",Single Malt Scotch,91,350,"quite lively for 25 years, with layers of bright fruit (lemon, nectarine, grapefruit, pineapple) on a bed of vanilla and honey. there’s a peppering of dried spice, smoldering ember, and beach pebbles. lightly smoky, dried spice finish. very nice. brora enthusiasts will not be disappointed, but the prices of the whisky from this shuttered distillery are creeping up.
"
"bruichladdich black art 05.1 1992, 48.4%",Single Malt Scotch,91,330,"as ever, the composition of black art is a closely guarded secret, and this is distiller adam hannett’s first such assembly. rich aromas of fig, succulent autumn berries, sherry, cream, and malt feature on the complex, floral nose. viscous on the palate, which opens dry, with developing berry fruits and spicy oak, plus dried fruits and candied peel. long and drying in the finish, with plum and peppery oak."
"bruichladdich 1986, 44.6%",Single Malt Scotch,91,"1,100","this expression was distilled in december 1986 and filled into seven oloroso sherry butts. in 2012 the whisky was transferred to pedro ximénez butts for finishing. the nose yields sultanas, figs, old leather, and white pepper. very sweet fruit notes on the palate, almost sugary, with background rich sherry, dates, and treacle. long and warming in the finish, with a wisp of smoke and fruit spices. (4,200 bottles)"
scott,Single Malt Scotch,91,130,"gold color with amber hues. mature aromas of toffee and nuts, marzipan and candied fruit. medium body and chewy in texture. a very mature whisky with evolutions of flavors-toffee, caramel, fudge, nuts, fruitcake, and a long finish that dries out very nicely. older expressions of bunnahabhain are often quite delicious, and this one is no exception. the dryness of the oak balances perfectly with the sweeter toffee notes of the whisky, and the extra age imparts considerable depth."
"caol ila feis ile bottling 2013, 56.5%",Single Malt Scotch,91,152,"although aged in refill, then active hoggies, and finally sherry, there’s more smoke
than oak here, a smoke like the aroma of a fire clinging to a tweed jacket. a
note akin to wilting spinach gives way to more conventional strawberries and
cream, but always mixed with seashore breezes. this is caol ila in deep and
bold mood with green fig, banana, and a sweet center. water gives greater
integration. you might (just) be able to get this. do it. (distillery only) £99"
"signatory (distilled at caol ila) 1984, 54.7%",Single Malt Scotch,91,258,"clearly caol ila; it’s the way that the oily smokiness seems to lean into the nose, bearing with it wet oilskins, a barely smoldering wood fire, light seashore elements (drying crab shells), and very pure fruit, which then opens to classic smoked ham aromas. retronasally, there’s a touch of green pea pod. the smokiness is more assertive than normal on the tongue, with olive oil, deep fruits, and a pine-scented juniper note. another belter. (the whisky exchange only) £155"
"clynelish, 57.3%",Single Malt Scotch,91,96,"there’s something enigmatic and highly attractive about this distillery and its deceased brother, brora. perhaps it’s the unpredictability; there are plenty of independent releases of varied and often questionable quality, and you’re never quite sure what’s going to turn up. even iconic expressions such as the 30 year olds can vary from quite sublime to appalling and sulfury when in the wrong hands.
when the malts from both distilleries are good, though — and the official bottlings tend to be — they’re very, very good. this clynelish is a delightful surprise from the beginning, its nose some way removed from the official 14 year old, and more in common with some recent diageo-release broras, mixing soft maritime notes with squiggly peat and some fruit notes. the palate is complex and attractive, with savory peat, sweet pineapple, salt, light fish, drizzled lemon, pepper, chili, and cardamom. it all makes for a big, complex, evolving (and grown up) whisky — and great value for the price tag. "
"cragganmore 25 year old (diageo special release 2014), 51.4%",Single Malt Scotch,91,500,"the question is how this stacks up against the friends of the classic malts bottling, one of my 2014 highlights. this shows mature distillery character with that discreet meaty undertow bedding down exuberant top notes: icing sugar on rhum baba, preserved lime, crystallized fruits, honey, pecan, fig, and scented woods. typical of cragganmore in its constantly shape-shifting character. the palate is concentrated orchard fruits, dried fruits, light spice, chestnut puree, and a little smoke. so yes, in the same league. (3,372 bottles)"

"the dalmore distillery exclusive 1991, 59%",Single Malt Scotch,91,236,"staff members at dalmore selected this distillery-exclusive bottling, which has been drawn from american white oak cask number 446, and bottled at cask strength. the out-turn comprises 450 bottles. refined, polished oak on the nose. honey, marzipan, caramel, and vanilla. fragrant, with old leather and over-ripe oranges when water is added. warm leather, apricots, orange marmalade, cocoa powder, and developing spice on the palate. a long, spicy, citric finish. finally, licorice. £150"

"dalmore port collection vintage 1996, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,91,592,"dalmore launched a trio of vintages finished in tawny port pipes. the pick of the bunch is the oldest, distilled in 1996, which displays a confident, rich nose of raisins, mildly smoky prunes, vanilla, and blood orange. full-bodied in the mouth, with red berry fruits, ginger, white pepper, and spicy oak. medium-length in the finish, with coffee-soaked oak, figs, and damsons at the close. £450"

"glenfarclas family cask 1970 (cask 140), 57.1%",Single Malt Scotch,91,530,"another first fill sherry butt, giving its typical reddish-brown hue. this runs more into the clove, cassia, and allspice area than just dried fruit. while maturity is obvious, and there’s even a hint of dunnage/leatheriness, it is the concentrated fruit sweetness that surprises here. the distillery has fought back against the cask, and while still crepuscular in nature, there is a rich, concentrated, and mellow glow at its heart. £345"
"the coronation (distilled at glenfarclas) 1953, 51.1%",Single Malt Scotch,91,9500,"only 60 bottles have been released from this 60 year old first-fill sherry cask. amazingly, the nose is not dominated by wood, but is mature and concentrated with the aroma of rain-moistened tweed, tropical fruit, blonde tobacco, cedar, and chanterelle mushroom. this elegantly faded, sepia-tinted impression continues on the tongue: fine-boned, mossy, clean, and slowly drying. a classic example of oxidation, not woodiness, allowing
freshness to be retained. amazing. (the whisky exchange exclusive.) £6,000"
"glenfiddich, cask #4414, 1977 vintage, 54.1%",Single Malt Scotch,91,750,"very elegant and refined. obviously this whisky was aged in a pristine sherry cask. the flavors are quite clean and well-defined. gently sweet and fruity, with golden raisin, candy apple, and red raspberry jam. there’s delicate pineapple, dried cherry, coconut, and vanilla too, with a polished oak finish. a very classy glenfiddich. not as bold and spicy as last year’s 1976 vintage (which i had a hand in selecting but, ironically, don’t like as much). this new vintage approaches the caliber of the 1973 vintage release from two years ago which i still think is the best one in recent years. 
"
"glenfiddich winter storm 21 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,91,250,"glenfiddich’s experimental series continues with this expression, finished for up to 6 months in ice wine casks sourced from peller estates winery in ontario, canada. concentrated aromas of canned peaches in syrup, vanilla, and clotted cream. silky on the palate, with a carryover of peaches from the nose and succulent blood oranges. the finish is medium in length, slowly drying, but fruity to the end. (7,800 bottles in u.s.)"
"glenglassaugh 30 year old, 44.8%",Single Malt Scotch,91,395,"the first release from the new owners of glenglassaugh distillery is obviously intended as a showpiece expression, and it does not disappoint. due in the states next year. damp moss and cedar on the early nose. sultanas, candied orange, maraschino cherries, and sherry. treacle notes in time. spicy fruits, figs, brittle toffee, sherry, and ginger on the mellow yet robust palate. the finish is medium in length, with allspice and old oak, plus a wisp of tarry smoke. £245"
"murray mcdavid 'mission' (distilled at glenlivet) 1974, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,91,150,"deep gold color. incredibly complex, subtle aromas of vanilla, honey, marshmallow, tropical fruit (pineapple, peaches, coconut), floral notes and a hint of almonds. medium-full in body, and firm. on the palate, the flavors are complex and exhibit the same notes as the aroma, starting out gently sweet, but gradually becoming fruity and eventually drying out on the finish. 
"
"the glenlivet nadurra triumph 1991, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,91,85,"richly textured with mouth-coating malt that is balanced by an array of lively fruit (fresh peach, nectarine, tangerine, pears in honey, and delicately caramelized pineapple). creamy caramel, crème brûlée, anise, and subtle toasted marshmallow add complexity, as does its gently spicy, pleasingly dry finish. two years older than the standard 16 year old nadurra (which i like for its vibrancy and freshness). this new triumph 1991 is richer and more textured, with more caramelized sugars, riper barley, and greater fruit impact. more mouth-coating too. (exclusive to the u.s.)
"
"the glenlivet cellar collection 1980 (bottled 2011), 43.3%",Single Malt Scotch,91,1593,"a vatting of three first-fill american oak casks, for me this is the most lifted and effusive of the ongoing cellar collection range. the nose is full of aromas of anise, blackcurrant leaf, honeysuckle, jasmine, frangipani flowers, and a subtle almond sweetness. the palate continues in similar vein with more spice and just sufficient oak to add distinct structure and a coconut character. sublime. it won’t, however, be released in the u.s. £1,000"
"glenmorangie, 25 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,91,875,"quite deep for a glenmorangie, but still surprisingly balanced. glenmorangie is a lighter-style spirit and, in the past, some of the older vintage expressions were heavy-handed on the wood. the oak aging is obvious on the nose, but this whisky manages to walk the thin line between enjoying the maturity and depth of an older whisky without too much oak influence.
"
"glenmorangie bacalta, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,91,100,"the 8th private edition release. this one is finished in sun-baked casks which previously contained malmsey madeira. a predominantly sweet and fruity whisky, with caramel, honeyed almonds, peaches in syrup, and orange scone. soft, soothing finish. delicious!"
"glenrothes, 1987 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,91,100,"the most recent vintage from the 1980s. this whisky is very bright and lively. it dances on the palate with orange, tangerine, and lemon gum drops, balanced by vanilla, light caramel, hint of anise, and delicate oak. a whisky with great finesse and drinkability. 
"
"lagavulin, distillers' edition, 1991 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,91,100,"more polished and sophisticated than the comparably sweet and lush lagavulin 21 year old also reviewed here. the pedro ximinez cask finish certainly gives as much as it takes away when compared to the benchmark 16 year old. an array of complex ripe fruit, interwoven with notes of pot still rum, toffee, tar, seaweed, and brine on the finish. it seems logical to marry this big, smoky islay whisky with an equally big, sweet, fruity sherry. in this case, the marriage works wonderfully.
"
"lagavulin, 52.5%",Single Malt Scotch,91,112,"you want and expect rich and peaty malt from lagavulin and you get it here in droves, though not in the most obvious way. this version is somewhere between the cask strength 12 year old and the distiller’s edition, rather than the standard 16 year old, but it’s an absolute peach and a treat for lovers of this distillery. the nose is constrained and shy at first, with lychee and kiwi fruit offering a sweet and gentle carpet to coastal peaty notes. the palate is big, rich, full, and peppered, with sharp apple and citrus fruits. it benefits from water, too, as there’s a delightful swell of fruit, chili, peat, and soft licorice. as with all great lagavulins, the tarry peatiness lingers longest in the finish."
"laphroaig, 30 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,91,225,"deep amber color. wonderfully complex, and nicely balanced aroma and flavor of vanilla sweetness, tarry rope, oak, toffee, seaweed, and brine. medium to full in body, and creamy in texture, with a finish that doesn't quit."
"laphroaig quarter cask, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,91,50,"the whisky begins sweet and creamy, with notes of vanilla, honey, and ripe malt (reminiscent of a malting floor). then the laphroaig signature peat smoke, seaweed, tar, and medicinal notes emerge. bottling at 48% and without chill-filtering keeps the whisky from being dulled down. a whisky that is very dynamic. nicely done. 
"
"hart brothers (distilled at laphroaig), 1990 vintage, 18 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,91,135,"bottled at 46% and not chill-filtered. smart move! it really helps this whisky. this is a soft — almost elegant — laphroaig (if that’s not an oxymoron). very clean, with honeyed malt, ripe barley, brine, seaweed, and peat smoke, with just a teasing of the medicinal, band-aid notes that laphroaig is known for. the owner-bottled 18 year old, which i rated a 90, is darker and drier, with more oak on the finish. i like this hart brothers expression just a little better."
"longmorn 23 year old, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,91,1450,"the oldest house bottling of longmorn to date is non-chill filtered and lavishly presented in a purple casket, which probably accounts for a chunk of the purchase price. the nose is classic longmorn: soft and sweet, majoring in honey, hazelnuts, caramel, and milk chocolate, while the creamy palate features orchard fruits, ginger, and allspice. the finish is lengthy and softly spiced, with honey, orange, and sweet oak."
"macallan sherry oak 18 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,91,118,"macallan’s 18 year old expression is, for me, the highlight of its regular sherried range. deep amber in color. the nose is rich and heavily fruited: fruit cake, mulberry, a little moist gingerbread, the bloody depths of molasses. on the palate, dried fruits — more figgy than raisined — while the natural oiliness in the spirit balances the boisterous tannins from the european oak. a singed note on the finish (an extension of the molasses?) completes the picture. balanced and complex."
"macallan masters of photography 3rd release 1989 cask #12251, 56.6%",Single Malt Scotch,91,2750,"dark mahogany with ruby glints and a green rim. lots of highly-polished oak as we move out of the woods and into a silent country estate. wax polish and masses of whisky rancio. sherry-soaked oak, dry leaves, currants, and ripe blackberry. highly concentrated, but the fruits push their way through only lightly-resisting tannins. there’s a hint of smoke and seville orange bitterness on the finish. my pick of the quartet. excellent. 285 bottles. "
"mortlach 16 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,91,65,"with worm tubs and a fiendishly complex partial-triple distillation, mortlach has adhered to an old style of making whisky — and older, richer, darker flavors. big and bold, it is at its best in ex-sherry casks. the nose is meaty (think gravy/beef stock) with fig, raisin, and molasses. in the mouth it’s concentrated, with good grip and a savory sweetness. a cult malt. £41 (not available in the u.s.)"
"gordon & macphail (distilled at old pulteney), 35 year old, 1969 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,91,200,"surprisingly fresh - sanguine even - for its age, and appetizingly aromatic. fairly light and approachable in body, but always inspiring and pithy. notes of fresh, seabreeze brine, teasing exotic spices, and tangerine are softened by gently creamy malt notes and hints of coconut and almond. very delicious and enjoyable anytime."
"old pulteney 40 year old, 51.3%",Single Malt Scotch,91,2313,"the oldest bottling of old pulteney to date has been matured in american bourbon and spanish sherry casks, and was personally bottled by distillery manager malcolm waring. the nose of this highly accomplished veteran is fragrant and waxy, with cooking apples, milk chocolate orange, christmas spices, vanilla, and fudge. initially, the substantial palate offers spicy fresh fruits, seasoned timber, then a hint of brine, with sultanas and plain chocolate. the finish is figgy, gingery, and sherried.  £1,490"
"the mcgibbons provenance (distilled at port ellen), 19 year old, 1982, 62.5%",Single Malt Scotch,91,110,"amber color. full aroma of peat smoke, with interwoven notes of seaweed, burning leaves, leather, and fudge. medium in body, with a slight oily texture. powerful and evolving in flavor, with great depth. it begins somewhat sweet up front with notes of vanilla and toffee, followed by a peat smoke explosion. lingering notes of seaweed, oak, salt and pepper add complexity. finally, the whisky becomes slightly sweet again, with lingering smoke. 
"
"lombard jewels of scotland (distilled at springbank) 21 year old 1991 cask no. 172, 49.7%",Single Malt Scotch,91,375,"aged in a bourbon hogshead, allowing the distillery character to shine through. fresh, lively and inviting (especially for its age), with a complex array of tropical and summer fruit, peppered with brine, vanilla, and a hint of baker’s chocolate. an oily texture adds weight. dry, deliciously appetizing finish. an excellent aperitif whisky, but enjoyable anytime. (d & m wines and liquors exclusive.)"
"springbank local barley 16 year old, 54.3%",Single Malt Scotch,91,135,"the first of five annual releases of local barley from springbank. this practice revives a concept discontinued in 2001. the barley in question was grown at low machrimore farm in the south of the kintyre peninsula and was distilled in september 1999. barley, damp earth, sea salt, and citrus fruits on the lightly peated nose. the buttery palate yields spicy peat, orchard fruits, and more earthiness, closing with smoky lemon."
"bowmore, 18 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,91,85,"this replaces the 17 year old in the standard bowmore portfolio. (the 17 year old will now be duty free only). the difference is significant. this one is more sherried than the 17 year old, and it wears the sherry well. i know that many of you, like myself, adore the 17 year old. indeed, i feel that the 17 year old displays the true essence of bowmore. but this 18 year old integrates the sherry notes with the bowmore signature to create a richly flavored islay whisky experience. thick toffee, ripe fruit, and tar-tinged smoke are accentuated by dark chocolate, cocoa powder, burnt raisin, dates, and sea salt. long, entertaining finish. 
"
"mackillop's choice (distilled at tomintoul), 37 year old, 1966 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,91,150,"fresh and lively for its age, with appetizing saltiness, citrus fruit (lemon, line and orange marmalade), and subtly complex dried spices. a fat, malty foundation complements these seasonings beautifully mid-palate, with the salt and dried spices emerging again on the finish. very sophisticated. 
"
"tomintoul five decades, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,91,359,"the soft fruit theme continues in this vatting of whiskies from, you guessed it, five decades of the distillery’s life. this has a heavy, heady, honey element alongside apple blossom and then peach and apricot pulp. there’s real complexity. the palate is lighter, although still layered with some heat. with water there’s more apricot skin and some banana. don’t overwater, as it becomes a touch too tannic. you want that unctuous elegance. highly recommended. £250"
"tomatin, 40 year old, 1967 vintage, 42.9%",Single Malt Scotch,91,1000,"significantly darker than the rest, well-balanced, and palate-coating. softer, not as intense or as dry as the 30 year old. creamier too, with subtle, yet exotic notes of tropical fruit and exotic spices. there is a point at which ultra-aged spirits -- whether they are whisky, rum, tequila, or brandy -- find a common ground. what they lose in identity, they gain in intrigue and layers of subtle complexity (if properly matured). this whisky fits into that category. contemplative and ethereal in nature."
"tullibardine 1952, 40.2%",Single Malt Scotch,91,23427,"this bottling is from the oldest cask owned by tullibardine distillery, a sherry quarter cask (#341). an initial whiff of cointreau on the nose, then vanilla develops, with marzipan, white pepper, linseed, and old hessian. finally, musty sherry. a silky mouthfeel, with drier sherry, black currants, dark spices, and plain chocolate. extraordinarily lingering, with orange wine gums and spicy licorice. despite 50 years of maturation in a relatively small sherry cask, a whisky of great depth and quality has emerged. £16,000"
"oban, 18 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,91,150,"drier, less toffee and fruit, more dried spice and oak when compared to the standard oban 14 year old.  a beautiful combination of rich, nutty toffee balanced by polished oak, salt, pepper, seaweed, distant smoke, and dried fruit.  somewhat oily in texture.  wonderful depth, too!  an improvement on what is already the biggest-selling diageo single malt scotch in the u.s.  very exciting and dynamic.  (7,700 bottles available only in the u.s. and at the oban distillery).
"
"oban, 2000 vintage, 58.7%",Single Malt Scotch,91,488,"matured in a sherry cask. lush, with glazed citrus, caramelized peach, chewy toffee, roasted nuts, and subtle pine needles. the sherry is a driving force throughout this whisky, but it’s obviously from a very clean, polished european oak cask. very delicious, with a long, satiating finish. quite impressive for such a young whisky. my favorite of the bunch. (534 bottles) £300"
"the last drop 1965 blend 48 year old, 48.6%",Blended Scotch Whisky,91,4000,"originally blended, then recasked into fresh bourbon wood three decades ago, the nose of ripened peaches, cooked pear, pecan nuts, menthol, clove, and vanilla make for a compelling combination. a surprising lift of red summer fruits as this bright whisky sashays around the mouth, the complexity measured out in installments; plum sauce, toasted oak, coffee bean, gingersnaps, clove, licorice, and hints of savory juices. it dances on and on with the whirling wood spices in no hurry whatsoever. (592 bottles)"
"cutty sark tam o' shanter 25 year old, 46.5%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,91,329,"in my opinion cutty sark 25 year old is one of the great blends, so a new version was always going to be a big ask. this one comes with a lot of packaging, so is it a victory for style over substance? not at all. this is all about big flavors; burnt orange, juicy raisin, and dark chocolate; rich oak and exotic spice. a treat, and worthy of its heritage. but at that price—and bearing in mind it's a limited edition—are you going to open it? "
"port askaig, 17 year old, 45.8% ",Single Malt Scotch,91,81,"a new line of islay single malts from specialty drinks, an extension of the whisky exchange. (the bottle doesn’t tell you which distillery this whisky came from, but if you look at a map of islay you can probably figure it out.) i like this expression better than the more expensive 25 year old. there’s impeccable balance and more vibrancy in this 17 year old, with seaweed, smoked spanish olive, coal soot, pencil shavings, citrus, and anise, along with subtle kipper and picked ginger. all this is layered on a bed of oily, honeyed malt. salty, peppery, sooty, tarry finish. nicely done! £50"
"kilchoman 2007, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,91,51,"the first thing i wrote was, “classic kilchoman.” then i paused…because it’s true. though still young, here’s a distillery that has established its own character. in this expression you get full integration between oak and distillery, a sparkling mix of seashell and the freshness of seaweed, touched with churned butter, driftwood, and fresh-kilned peat. on the tongue, there’s samphire, peat, sweet barley, and an herbal kick. this is kilchoman coming of age, assured and confident."
"kilchoman 2009 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,91,100,"matured in a combination of oloroso sherry butts filled in 2008, and bourbon barrels filled in 2008 and 2009. the nose is initially flinty, with lemongrass, fabric band-aids, fudge, and vanilla. ultimately the lemon is joined by jaffa orange juice. supple and sweet on the palate, with developing nutmeg and white pepper. peppery in the finish, with plain chocolate and aromatic peat smoke. (840 bottles)"
"duncan taylor (distilled at royal lochnagar) 23 year old 1986, 46.3%",Single Malt Scotch,91,200,"soft, soothing, and gentle. layered fruit (bright orchard fruit, honeyed melon, kiwi, pineapple), polished oak, and hay, subtly spiced with vanilla bean, milk chocolate, evergreen, and cotton candy. bottled at peak maturity. very more-ish, too! (a park avenue liquor exclusive.)"
"ballantine’s 17 year old signature distillery editions – scapa, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,91,80,"as you raise the glass to your nose, this has refreshment written all over it. the fragrance of an early morning visit to a florist, zesty orange notes, honey, peach pits, a hint of salt, and the faintest trace of smoke. it’s silky smooth, glistening with honey, a firm edge of orange, vanilla tablet, barley sugar, powdered ginger, all elevated by the grains supporting the scapa. a smooth, feather-light finish of sparkling light spices and creaminess. a joy to behold."
"the sovereign (distilled at cambus) 50 year old 1964, 49.2%",Single Grain Whisky,91,657,"you really don’t see many of these. pear drops, stewed apple, strawberry jam, fragrant rhubarb stems, and vanilla pods. neat, there’s a tacky sweetness of hard candy, with bitter skins of damson and green plum, sloes, and custard creams. counteract this with water to bring out acetone, cake mix, and sweet bourbon notes of vanilla and creamed coconut. then it is triumphant. dry oak and dark vanilla complete one of the longest finishes i’ve savored this year. (111 bottles) £420"
"that boutique-y whisky company (distilled at bruichladdich) 23 year old, 47.4%",Single Malt Scotch,91,111,"there is a beautiful interplay between the lemon and sharp lime set against the bracing coastal nature of this dram. gentle vanilla, honey, lemon zest, and gooseberry compote waft from the glass. vanilla frosting, coconut macaroon bars, malt drinks, peach, lemon, and an undercurrent of pepper. creamy chocolate once the spice subsides, it ends with a fantastically chewy mouthfeel. nuts, pepper, and cocoa make for a mouth-coating finish."
"that boutique-y whisky company blended whisky #1 35 year old (batch 3), 46.5%",Blended Scotch Whisky,91,150,"this dark, chestnut liquid exudes wafts of rose hip, dense fruitcake, sliced fig, cherry, oak, brazil nut, and earthy, fragrant damp moss within the rich sherry complexity. a voluptuous, palate-saturating whisky, with burnt orange, ginger spices, star anise, dried fig, and ripe purple plums, concluding with chocolate truffles. it’s a rollicking good blend, dripping with sherry notes, and leaves a deep glow far back in the palate. you’re going to love it. (1,428 bottles) £120"
"royal salute special batch 21 year old polo edition, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,91,145,"a pedigree blend gracing your glass with aromas of sultana, prune, glacé cherry, toffee, nutmeg, dense dark fruits, sweet toffee, and cozy christmas spices. this well-paced, silky blend canters through red apple, cherry, pomegranate, pressed date bars, brazil nut, nutmeg, and pepper. cinnamon, black pepper, and apple peel make for a harmonious finish. a suitably glamorous libation for spectators of the sport of kings. £110"
"douglas laing extra old particular (distilled at mortlach) 22 year old, 57.1%",Single Malt Scotch,91,280,"deep amber. generous sweet sherried nose; very ripe, with dried orchard fruits, chestnut puree, and indeed chestnut honey, then a little touch of meat and a pungency akin to guyanan pot still rum. sumptuous. as it opens there’s a fluxing mix of sticky toffee, game, pomegranate, and dried red fruits. the palate is deeply savory, with floor polish and cooked plums, finishing with fragrant pepper. the cask has a huge say in things, but the spirit copes. excellent. £191"
"craigellachie 23 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,91,536,"here we see a significant step-change from the progression of 13 to 19 (see below). now, there is added spice, ripe fresh cooked and dried fruits, and a touch of the peat smoke that used to be lightly added. with water, a mix of maple syrup and waxiness comes through. complex and deep. the palate remains thick and silky, with melted white chocolate before lilies make an appearance alongside baked pineapple. structured, layered, long, and elegant. £337"
"gordon & macphail (distilled at strathisla) 1967, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,91,763,"part of the rare vintage range, this was matured in first-fill sherry butts. spicy sultanas and figs on the nose, plus a menthol note. fragrant old hessian. the palate is initially malty-sweet, with sherried christmas cake notes, then plain chocolate and raisins emerge. the finish is long, spicy, and drying in a leisurely manner, with the expected level of tannins for a whisky of this vintage.£620"
"timorous beastie 40 year old, 54.7%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,91,246,"there should be few qualms about snapping up this aged highland gem given the blender’s prowess and the generous pricing. ripe stone fruit, straw, sweet oak, and ground almond on the nose. for its advancing years, it’s quite a ride at full strength; thick, glossy, and mouth-coating with tangy sweet oranges, fudge, and candied citrus. best sipped neat, it ebbs away with bright orange fruit and buzzy spices. (1,080 bottles) £200"
"cadenhead’s (distilled at linkwood) 1989, 51.1%",Single Malt Scotch,91,300,"powerful and rich to begin with. some raisin syrup backed with clean, apple-like acidity adding some freshness. this swells into a deep but refined musky apple/pear note with some black fruits behind. highly complex, but full of distillery character. water brings out a note like freshly-applied varnish. the palate is smooth, gentle, and deep. a classic mature linkwood with all of the distillery character on show in perfect alliance with the cask."
"hart brothers (distilled at glen grant) 22 year old, 51.1%",Single Malt Scotch,91,103,"a welcome return for hart brothers. this glen grant is light, clean, and penetrating, with lots of gooseberry, melon, basil, and cut grass. this turns into an intriguing note of concentrated fruits; think yellow wine gums and fresh william pear. the palate has classic glen grant purity, with a hint of tropical fruits. water adds another graceful layer on top, making the effect more like a rose garden…one which you keep returning to. excellent. £66"
"usquaebach an ard ri cask strength, 57.1%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,91,200,"this 2016 release in its ceramic flagon entices you with lemon, soft fruits, honey, digestive biscuits, and taffy candy. it’s dense and weighty; oozing with flavors of barley sugar, caramel, sweet oak, and some mature orange peel characteristics underpinned with ginger and pepper. profoundly long, sweet finish pricked with bitter orange and spice. one of those great drams that you can happily imbibe at cask strength without dilution. (2,000 bottles)"
"ailsa bay, 48.9%",Single Malt Scotch,91,79,"the first release from ailsa bay distillery is an nas peated single malt. the new make spirit initially spends 6 to 9 months in 24 to 100-liter hudson baby bourbon casks. it’s then transferred to virgin oak, first-fill, and refill american oak casks for several years. the ultimate vatting is non-chill filtered. a sweet, smoky nose with almonds and walnuts leads into a palate featuring citrus fruit, spicy peat, and cereal notes, with cocoa and soft oak in the finish. (uk and nordic availability) £55"
"jura one and all, 51%",Single Malt Scotch,91,158,"this limited edition 20 year old assemblage was matured in bourbon barrels, sherry casks, cabernet franc casks, cabernet sauvignon casks, and pinot noir barriques. rich and sweet on the nose, with marzipan, apricot jam, and fresh pineapple with vanilla custard. silky, with ginger, cherries, and caramel on the palate. the finish is long, with black pepper, licorice, and slightly tannic oak.

(670 bottles)"
"buchanan’s red seal, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,91,169,"inhale deeply and this bestows a sense of serenity; morning dew on clipped lawns strewn with spent fireworks and strands of honey mingled with subtle, elegant smoke. blender maureen robinson’s light, well-balanced creation ushers in gentle honey and growing sweetness, before billowing puffs of smoke grow dominant. charred peaks of a lemon meringue pie, iced coffee, and milk chocolate follow, leaving a catch of smoke in the aftertaste. quite a charmer."
"alexander murray & co. the monumental 18 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,91,65,"sweet caramel on the boundary of maple syrup flavors, with aging tobacco leaf, walnuts, malted barley, charcoal sticks, and snuffed candle wicks, all cushioned by soft oak. an initial impression of a lighter character, though it’s bursting with juicy toffee, butterscotch sauce, wood spices, and dried banana. the spices vibrate gently around the gums on the dry finish of this high-malt content blend, leaving nutty residual flavors."
"rock oyster sherry edition, 46.8%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,91,60,"the salty coastal twang meets the sherry head on, revealing mandarin, gingerbread, glazed ham, clove, seashells, and driftwood bonfires built on pebble beaches. smoke comes to dominate the sherry. orange oils precede a delayed ignition of the spices. more honeyed sweetness comes through, while a smothering layer of peat rises up. warm spicy finish, until a thick curtain of smoke closes it down. but hey, this rocks."
"compass box last vatted malt, 53.7%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,287,"not compass box at the very top of its game, but pretty damn good nevertheless. this is a mix of malts from different distilleries and it has the company's distinctive dna all over it, combining siege cannon-strength peated malt with rich, fruity, sherried whisky. it's clumsier than the wonderful flaming heart but in the same ballpark, and i have to declare an interest — i adore this combination when it's delivered right. £180 "
"compass box the lost blend, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,120,"the smoking wicks of church candles, smoked meat, coastal notes, cumin, coriander seed, and herbal elements. a sophisticated palate of unsweetened fruit. peaches, citrus, and pineapple, with a waxy presence building later on, settles to a dry finish of herbs and beeswax. we can easily overlook the narcissism of making tributes to your own past bottlings as john glaser turns whisky resurrectionist in homage to eleuthera. layered, complex, thought provoking, and finely tuned for the connoisseur."
"compass box oak cross, 43%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,59,"compared to asyla, this has noticeable added richness, fruit, and spice. the nose brings apple danish, creamy custard, honey, citrus peel, and the fragrance of lightly toasted spices. against a core of rich, tangy fruits, a spicy partnership of pepper and clove manifests under the tongue, stealthily curls around the sides, and storms the palate. the mouth-coating finish drips with mandarin and cooked apple pierced by clove."
"compass box delilah's, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,90,65,"a special bottling in recognition of chicago's outstanding alternative rock venue delilah's, and like that venue this is full of character, color, grit, and determination. it's sweet but never cloying, soft and honeyed but gutsy, and there are peppermint, licorice, and fresh hay notes in the mix, too. it's spent time in bourbon wood and that shows. a departure for compass box, but a healthy one."
"compass box the peat monster, 46%",Blended Scotch Whisky,90,60,"a fantastically earthy whisky bristling with real, grubby peat: more blazing, bothy peat fire than coastal campfire. fleeting elements of fudge and smoldering, mellow cigar stubs. a smooth, creamy blend with lemon curd, vanilla sponge, mint, smoked prosciutto, and a dollop of malt. there’s wonderfully smoky, singeing heat at the back of the palate, though it feels like the islay peat has been pegged back for the 2015 batch. a succulent and smoky finish to warm the soul."
compass box hedonism maximus,Grain Scotch Whisky,90,300,"an older, more exotic expression of hedonism, consisting of 42 year old invergordon and 29 year old cameron bridge grain whiskies. straw gold color. this is richer and cleaner than most other grain whisky offerings, which are often too thin and overweight with dry oak. like many older grain whiskies, creamy vanilla, coconut custard, and a variety of tropical fruits abound. additional notes of toasted marshmallow, caramelized apricot, golden raisin, and a gentle dried spice finish add complexity. surely one of the better examples of this rather eccentric category.
"
"johnnie walker island green, 43%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,60,"what happens when you light a bonfire underneath green label? earthy peat smoke with medicinal characteristics of lanolin and antiseptic, a salty tang balanced with creamy vanilla, strands of citrus, and touches of menthol and aniseed. smooth as a thief in the night; mouth-coating toffee, growing smoky notes, and peppered mackerel push back the waxy, citrus elements. now the fire is alive; the sweetness gets out while it can. (travel retail exclusive)"
"johnnie walker double black, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,90,40,"so how brave can you be? would you take one of the world's most iconic blends and risk messing with it? if you've got a whisky maker as good as jim beveridge, then why not? this picks up from the regular jw black and its signature caol ila smoke and peat heart and then adds to it, doing exactly what it says on the tin. but the clever part of this is upping the apple, orange, and fruit content too. great. "
"johnnie walker blenders’ batch no. 3 triple grain american oak 10 year old, 41.3%",Blended Scotch Whisky,90,30,"wheat, corn, and malted barley are your three grains here. orange grove before harvest, a rounded candied peel note, plenty of sweet grain, and creamy vanilla, all backed by gentle spice. luscious and chewy caramel, taffy candy, lavishly rich orange, and glowing spice notes wrap around the tongue. it’s incredible how they can make this tasty blend of five whiskies look so devastatingly easy (when it’s not). value pick"
"royal salute 21 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,90,170,"not exactly a new whisky for the jubilee, just a new pack, but it’s a good enough excuse to have a look at this top-end blend. great maturity with masses of orchard fruits and a hint of passion fruit as well. the oak is rounded and supple while with water a banana note is released. thick and chewy, with more grip than suggested on the nose and a little nut on the finish. great blending. "
"dewar’s 15 year old the monarch, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,90,50,"the divine stone fruit aromas are the key to unlocking the nose on this one: apricot, honey, vanilla icing, malt bins, quaker oats squares, and lofty floral top notes. sweet mandarin, brown sugar, vanilla fudge, strands of finely shredded peel, and more spice than the 12 year old can muster. the sweet vanilla aftertaste is softer and more elegant than the younger expressions."
"king's crest, 25 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,90,125,"amber gold color. aromas of delicate fruit, coconut, vanilla and toffee, with delicate background oak notes. the flavor delivers what the aroma promises. it is nicely balanced, with a lingering dryish finish. 
"
"aberlour a'bunadh, 59.9%",Single Malt Scotch,90,60,"amber, with shades of ruby and gold. aromas of complex ripe fruit (golden raisins, marmalade, cherries, apples), toffee, treacle, and hint of mint. full, rich texture and body-almost chewy. flavors of lush fruit drenched with honey and caramel. long, warming, slightly spicy finish. i'm so happy to see this fine whisky finally imported to the u.s. after being available in its homeland now for about two years. the name a'bunadh literally means ""the origin"" in gaelic, and it produced in the style of aberlour back in the late 1800s-at the natural strength and not chill filtered. it certainly is an exciting whisky, produced in small batches (mine was batch #6) from select oloroso sherry casks. i've noticed a slight variation in color from one batch to the next, largely due to the types of sherry casks selected."
"aberlour 16 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,90,55,"double cask matured. more subtle and complex than the new 12 year old, and not as sweet. creamy in texture and floral on the nose, with dried vanilla, gentle spice, nectarine, kiwi, plum, and lemon gum drops. soft, elegant finish with a hint of mint. great balance of a variety of flavors and lots of finesse. a well-crafted whisky!"
"aberlour a'bunadh, 60%",Single Malt Scotch,90,60,"amber, with shades of ruby. notes of complex honey-drenched fruit (sultana, marmalade, peaches, apples), toffee, treacle, and hint of mint. full, rich texture and lush body. long, warming, moderately spicy finish."
"murray mcdavid (distilled at ardbeg) 1990, 8 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,65,"pale white wine color. smoky, youthful aroma. there’s no surprises here-it definitely smells like a young ardbeg. big beautiful explosion of smoky, tarry flavors that evolve and seem to linger on the palate indefinitely.   style: islay single malt scotch whisky. price: low $60s. available nationwide. 
   this is the first ardbeg release i've tasted since the distillery's long shut down in the 1980s. after the shut down, they discontinued their floor maltings, so i was concerned that it might not taste like the ardbeg of old. ardbeg fans can let out a big sigh of relief. this one is big and gutsy-just the way we like it. my only criticism of this particular release is that it could have used about one or two more years in oak to tame some of the spirity nature of the whisky. otherwise, this is wonderful stuff!"
"ardbeg supernova (2010 release), 60.1%",Single Malt Scotch,90,130,"very dynamic, complex, and powerful. here’s what i’m picking up, in somewhat descending order in taste profile: leafy smoke, coal tar, mocha fudge with dark chocolate chips, smoked olive, peppered seaweed salad, fruit (lemon, lime), genever, brine-tinged grass, and (with some coaxing) floral notes (violet?). compared to last year’s debut release of supernova, this one is certainly comparable, but i feel it’s a tad richer, with more leafy smoke and ripe barley. it also seems a bit more polished, less aggressive. i like it a little more than its predecessor (which i rated an 89)."
"ardbeg perpetuum, 47.4%",Single Malt Scotch,90,100,"“ardbeg in perpetuum” would mean “ardbeg forever.” it’s made up of a mélange of different casks: american oak, refill, french oak…and others. intense, marine, with pineapple, wet moss, tar, cracked black pepper, and a nuttiness. the palate is oily, sweet, with smoked cream, balanced by a very pure acidity, then soot and char. will the fact that it isn’t an extreme ardbeg satisfy everyone? probably not. is it a bloody good session drink? damn right it is. (200th anniversary bottling)"
"ardmore, 30 year old, 53.7%",Single Malt Scotch,90,450,"the oldest ardmore i have tasted. smartly bottled at cask strength and not chill-filtered. (the entry level ardmore “traditional” is at the opposite end of the age spectrum, tasting quite youthful.) my initial concern with this 30 year old was: would the wood dominate the lovely floral, smoky notes i enjoy so much with ardmore? the wood is certainly present, but the smoke still comes through. there’s a gently layered sweetness that complements the smoke (toffee, deep caramel, subtle honey), licorice root, bourbon barrel char, coffee grounds, and high cocoa chocolate, with subtle dried citrus and a suggestion of floral soap. dry finish, with more bourbon barrel char and licorice root. considering that ardmore has historically been a blending malt, most of the stocks right now are much younger. this is a rare treat. it’s a wee bit thin in body and a little on the dry side from 30 years on wood for me to rate it in the mid 90s, but it’s still a very enjoyable whisky."
"the arran malt, madeira wine cask finish (2008 limited edition), 50%",Single Malt Scotch,90,75,"this is not a single-cask bottling like other recent wine-finished releases, but the casks they selected are very good ones. lovely antique amber color. the madeira dovetails beautifully with the malt and oak, and it has matured nicely for a whisky less than ten years old. lush notes of orange marmalade, raspberry tart, and panforte, all wrapped up in rich toffee and a dusting of nutmeg, cinnamon, and cocoa. a dry, resinous, spicy, tactile finish adds balance, complexity, and additional dimension. smartly bottled at a higher strength. some of these wine-finished arran whiskies are impressive. this is one of them."
"auchentoshan, 18 year old, 55.8%",Single Malt Scotch,90,100,"aged in first and (mostly) second fill sherry casks. the sherry is kept in balance and does not mask auchentoshan’s subtle beauty. the classic auchentoshan creamy, grassy, freshness abounds, complemented by honey-soaked almonds, cereal grain, and an array of bright fruit (citrus, sultana, mandarin). not as polished as the auchentoshan 21 year old, but quite entertaining. (420 bottles for the u.s.) 
"
"auchentoshan, 1966, 36 year old, 49.4%",Single Malt Scotch,90,120,"amber color, with gold hues. soft, subtly seductive aromas of creamy vanilla, crème brulee, tropical fruit, oak, and a hint of mint. light to medium in body-silky in texture at first, then becoming and firm. on the palate, the whisky starts out gently sweet, with creamy vanilla and honeyed malt. subtle tropical fruit notes arrive mid palate. the whisky then begins to dry out fairly rapidly (this is a 36 year old lowland after all), as dry resinous notes of vanilla, mint, and herbs reveal themselves. the whisky finishes dry, with notes of soft leather. the way the owners of auchentoshan and glen garioch are handling vintage bottlings now is that specialty retailer orders an entire cask and sells it exclusively. this one is a sam's exclusive. it's older than the previous, widely distributed 1966 bottling and less expensive too! you wouldn't expect a triple distilled lowland whisky to age so gracefully. auchentoshan is an exception to the rule. it has acquired the depth and maturity from extensive aging, yet it still manages to maintain its distillery character and lowland gentility. only on the dry finish does it really show its age. but that's a small price to pay for an otherwise very good single cask whisky at a very reasonable price for 36 years old."
"balvenie 30 year old, 47.3%",Single Malt Scotch,90,550,"a special balvenie to honor master distiller david stewart’s 30 years working at the distillery. this is a big and brooding dram. the aroma suggests it is aged in both bourbon and sherry oak. it’s complex and richly flavored (sweeter up front and increasingly dry towards its finish), with notes of honey, candied fruit, thick cut marmalade, vanilla, almonds, and prominent spicy oak notes. i’m picking up plenty of sherry in this new expression, which i like. it finishes firmly dry, with notes of spice and tannin. while i enjoy this whisky a great deal, you might want to seek out the balvenie 25 year old (which i rated a 93) while the odd bottle is still available. it is slightly more rounded on the palate, and less than half the cost. 
"
"balvenie, madeira cask, 17 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,90,120,"a harmonious marriage of fruit and spice. more balanced than last year’s sweet rum cask release. in fact, this is one of the most deftly-balanced whiskies i’ve tasted this year. bramble, ripe nectarine, caramel apple, honeyed vanilla, and golden raisin, spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg. soft (for balvenie), lingering, warm, dried spice finish. 
"
"balvenie tun 1401 batch 5, 50.1%",Single Malt Scotch,90,250,"so soon? this latest release of what is becoming a legendary series mixes nine casks—four butts, five hoggies—from between 1966 and 1990. hugely complex and obviously mature, it is one to sit and smell forever. marzipan, mocha, pain au chocolat, manuka honey; every sniff reveals another aroma. it opens into cigar, sandalwood, citrus, and ripe black fruits. the palate is equally layered and expansive. it takes water, but only a drop, for that density is all-important."
"balvenie tun 1401 batch 9, 49.3%",Single Malt Scotch,90,250,"this latest installment of the tun 1401 series is a classic expression of old, mature balvenie, where a waxiness akin to furniture polish slides into mead-like aromas; actually more like metheglin, as there’s an herbal, spiced element. its textural richness means it is best with water on the side, allowing deep earthy, licorice, and cigar ash tones to
develop, along with just the lightest squeeze of tannin. (u.s. only.)"
"balvenie dcs compendium 1st chapter 1968 46 year old (cask 7293), 45.9%",Single Malt Scotch,90,27620,"the oldest of the set shows a shift into a sense of calm and quietude. the dried blossoms of youth are there, still with a little color to them, while a curl of smoke also comes through. then, out of nowhere, a sudden eruption of tropical fruits, a flaring in the dying light. there’s no oakiness, just a distillery, framed, gently receding. a remarkable dram. it’s almost shameful to discuss cost! £19,000"
"balvenie 1981 35 year old, 43.8%",Single Malt Scotch,90,"60,000/set","a refill american oak hogshead matured this whisky. the nose offers malt, vanilla fudge, pineapple, and contrasting lemon. lively tropical fruits on the palate, almonds, walnuts, and ginger cookies, with ever-present oak. bitter coffee in the medium-length, leathery finish."
"benriach, 25 year old, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,90,325,"great balance between vibrant oak spice and lush, sherried fruit. interwoven notes of honeyed malt, vanilla, citrus fruit, milk chocolate, and lingering peat add complexity. quite large for a benriach and very fresh for its age. this whisky takes benriach to a higher level. 
"
"benriach, cask #4469, 1976 vintage, 30 year old, 55.5%",Single Malt Scotch,90,400,"beautifully clean and polished on the palate -- it still allows benriach’s other flavors to shine through. ripe, complex tropical fruit notes meld with delicate honey and suggestions of shortbread cookies and toasted coconut. teasing peat and smoke surfaces from time to time. this whisky is a lot of fun to drink. (800 bottles total; 120 for the u.s.)"
"benriach septendecim 17 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,80,"no hiding that this is one of benriach’s peated variants, with smoke coming at you like an out of control garden bonfire, but the inherent sweetness of the distillery character adds a counterpoint: cinnamon-dusted apples baking in the fire, before angelica and cannabis (someone tells me) come through. the interplay between fruits and grassy smoke continues on the palate alongside toffee, nougat, peach syrup, and salty licorice before the smoke returns. a belter. and a great price."
"benriach authenticus peated 30 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,555,"following on from 21 and 25 year old expressions of authenticus, benriach has now added its oldest variant yet to the lineup. the nose offers orchard fruits, honey, polished oak, and vanilla-tinged peat smoke. full and fruity on the palate, with sweet peat having a presence, plus milk chocolate and licorice. the finish is relatively long, with citrus fruit, ashy smoke, and a lingering herbal note. £400; not available in the u.s."
"benriach 25 year old, 46.8%",Single Malt Scotch,90,550,"matured in a mixture of oloroso sherry, bourbon, and virgin oak casks. honey, vanilla, and tropical fruits on the spicy, aromatic nose, with just a hint of oak. the honey and vanilla carry over to the palate, where they are joined by peaches, drinking chocolate, and subtle sherry. the finish dries steadily, with long-lasting citrus fruit. a stylish, complex dram."
"benromach 30 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,90,240,"we had some new benromachs from gordon & macphail last issue that illustrated what the firm has been up to since it purchased the site in 1992. this release comes from its previous incarnation as part of dcl. the elegant, mature nose shows an ‘old speyside’ light smokiness alongside barley, cacao, cigar humidor, and potpourri. the palate is gentle and unctuous with some sherried touches, while the smoke reruns on the very end. £150 (not available in the u.s.)"
"benromach triple distilled 2009, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,90,59,"benromach’s first triple-distilled single malt was matured in first-fill bourbon barrels. the nose offers peaches with a wisp of sweet smoke, vanilla, and a hint of lime. voluptuous and very sweet on the palate; intense sugary orchard fruits and stem ginger, with the characteristic benromach peat smoke dialed back. the finish embraces insistent black pepper, nutmeg, and very mild peat. £45"
"blair athol 23 year old (diageo special releases 2017), 58.4%",Single Malt Scotch,90,460,"this perthshire single malt was distilled in 1993 and aged in european oak sherry butts. brittle toffee, black treacle, aniseed, black pepper, and cigar boxes feature on the rich nose. the bold palate yields full, creamy sherry notes, almonds, ginger, old leather, and a slightly savory tang. long, warming, and peppery in the finish. (5,514 bottles)"
"bowmore, 34 year old, 1971 vintage, 51%",Single Malt Scotch,90,800,"a lovely example of a mature, sherried bowmore. its rich flavors evolve on the palate and are nicely balanced. lush fruit, juicy oak, damp peat, and kiln smoke are peppered with cinnamon, raisins, dates, and cocoa. warming, soothing finish. not quite black bowmore, but a delicious whisky nonetheless. 
"
"bowmore darkest, 15 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,90,65,"darkest now has an age statement of 15 years old. this new release is an improvement from the original darkest, both of which are succulently sherried. it is fuller in flavor and more visceral, in both the nose and palate. these differences are subtle, but positive. notes of lush fruit, raisin, pot-still rum, and heath bars. citrus and wood spices emerge, along with burning peat embers that linger on the finish. nicely done. 
"
"a. d. rattray (distilled at bowmore), 18 year old (cask #2075), 53.5%",Single Malt Scotch,90,100,"the fruit (orange marmalade, tangerine, fresh pineapple) is nearly as dominant as the leafy smoke. sweet notes of nutty caramel, honeyed barley, toffee, and nougat round out the palate. ginger, cinnamon, telicherry pepper, tobacco, and ash play a supporting role. lingering fruity, smoky finish. for those who like sherried islay whiskies."
"adelphi (distilled at bowmore) 12 year old 2000, 56.1%",Single Malt Scotch,90,92,"there’s a fascinating journey taking place here. the nose takes you indoors; caramelized tropical fruits, coffee cake, a spent fire in the grate, and just the merest whiff of the waves hitting the beach. the palate, however, places you squarely aboard a yacht under sail: salt spray, deck and engine oil, worn leather upholstery. it seems way more mature than 12 years. the intensity is lost with water, but you gain more smoke. a great bottling.  £59"
"bowmore devil’s casks 10 year old, 56.9%",Single Malt Scotch,90,90,"matured in first-fill sherry casks, here we have bowmore at its ballsiest, with massively bold notes of prune, dried fig, salted treacle, toffee, shoe leather, rose petal, and savory maritime edges that glance toward marmite, all of which are infiltrated by clouds of smoke. the palate has retained sweetness, mixing black cherry, pipe tobacco, and cloves. powerful and seriously impressive with fantastic balance that retains bowmore identity, adds richness, ups the peatiness, and leaves you under satan’s spell."
"bowmore laimrig 15 year old, 53.7%",Single Malt Scotch,90,118,"this bowmore has been finished in sherry casks, but without allowing the exuberance of the cask to overwhelm the dram. instead, there’s concentrated stone fruits, lifted smoke, dried mint, dark chocolate, bitter orange peels, and some smoke. there’s a teasing hint on the tongue of tropical fruits, then a deepening mix of plump dried figs and sultana. long, layered, with the smoke seamlessly involved, adding accents rather than fogging up proceedings. (whisky shop chain only) £70"
"signatory (distilled at brora), 24 year old, 1981 vintage, cask # 06/656, 60.1%",Single Malt Scotch,90,225,"the distillery closed in 1983, and was replaced by the clynelish distillery across the street. classic brora. fresh, and exuberant for a 25 year old whisky. briny, with citrus zest, fruit gum drops, dynamic spices, and a hint of seaweed and smoke. appetizing finish. all the flavors are well-integrated, and the whisky is very clean. if you don’t have a brora yet, get this one before it’s gone. 
"
"bruichladdich 15 year old, 2nd edition, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,80,"finished in chateau d’yquem casks, and it shows. there’s a creamy, honeyed sweetness and viscosity to this whisky that is very soothing. bruichladdich’s brisk sea character cuts through the lightly syrup-like thickness and keeps the whisky fresh and lively, while notes of golden raisin, peaches, lemon gum drops, vanilla, and coconut add complexity. satisfying salty/sweet finish. 
"
"bruichladdich 3d, the big peat, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,90,65,"a marriage of bruichladdich with three different peating levels. devotees of young, smoky islay whiskies will enjoy this one. it is youthful and explosive, with earthy peat smoke, fish nets, brine, and kiln ash. all this is tamed beautifully by notes of vanilla wafer, seductive malt, marshmallow, spiced peaches, and pear. 
"
"bruichladdich 1973 vintage, 40.2% abv",Single Malt Scotch,90,285,"this one is my favorite of the four distillery-bottled bruichladdich whiskies reviewed here. it still quite lively and nicely balanced for such a mature whisky (and reminiscent of the previous 1970 vintage in this respect), with some floral notes and brine emerging from its fruity, vanilla, truffle, nougat foundation. still, it maintains an air of lightness and freshness throughout, with a pleasingly dry, subtly spicy finish that lingers. 
"
"duncan taylor (distilled at bruichladdich), 34 year old, 1969 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,234,"an unusual, but very fine, bruichladdich, with sweet, chewy toffee notes i often associate with speyside whiskies, not islay (although i have tasted a few older bunnahabhain whiskies that were like this). layers of marzipan and chocolate fudge also emerge, and i even pick up some apple and black cherry fruit in the background. bruichladdich's ""sea breeze"" freshness rises through the chewy sweetness and provides balance and complexity."
"bruichladdich 10 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,57,"the first 10 year old distilled by the current owners back in 2001. lovely marriage of both bourbon and sherry casks, and quite fresh, with a maturity resembling a 12 year old, rather than 10. smooth on the palate and very drinkable, with creamy vanilla, honeycomb, banana bread, bright lemon, melon (honeydew, cantaloupe), tangerine, candied ginger, and delicate brine. with all the bruichladdich razzle-dazzle over the past decade, we can embrace this unpretentiously delicious laddie with open arms. "
"bruichladdich islay barley 2007 6 year old, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,90,72,"using barley grown on rockside farm, this is fresh, sweet (agave syrup), delicate, and lightly buttery, with touches of lily of the valley and lemon sponge cake mix. the cereal character is restrained, with a charred hint on the palate along with banana, mandarin, cassia, and pink marshmallows (untoasted). the laddie’s floral notes emerge late, and the whiff of white pepper on the end is all there is to remind you of its youth. a classy young whisky. £45"
"port charlotte islay barley 2008, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,90,87,"robust port charlotte character, with salami and jamon serrano to the fore. somewhat like eating a chorizo and roasted red pepper sandwich on the beach on a summer’s day, but it retains the sweet freshness of the distillery character. with water, the lovely smell of cow’s breath. there’s dry smoke to start with on the palate, becoming sweet (flash-fried scallop) with sugared almond on the finish. for me, pc comes fully of age here. £55"
"bruichladdich islay barley 2010, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,90,65,"quantities of optic and oxbridge barley varieties were grown on eight islay family farms during 2009, and the following year this grain was distilled, then matured in bourbon and french wine casks. the nose offers ginger, melon, malt, sweet (lit) pipe tobacco, freshly baled straw, resin, vanilla, and spice. chewy in the mouth; oily, with toffee spices and youthful oak notes. the finish features oysters with lemon squeezed over them."
"duncan taylor (distilled at bunnahabhain), 36 year old, 1967 vintage, 40.2%",Single Malt Scotch,90,160,"older expressions of this unpeated islay dram are often quite delicious, but they aren't easy to come by. the best ones, like this one, take the sweetish toffee/nutty foundation of younger expressions and add layers of depth and complexity. this whisky just continues to evolve on the palate. the entrance is creamy in texture with layers of sweetness (caramel, vanilla fudge, toffee), becoming nutty and marzipan-like with subtle background fruit. the finish is long and pleasingly dry, with a hint of salt. very entertaining and satisfying."
"bunnahabhain 25 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,90,265,"nougat and dates to the fore, then becoming increasingly nutty with suggestions of demerara rum and cinnamon and underlying polished leather. lovely dried spice notes and an appetizing salty tang teases the palate on the finish. 
"
"signatory (distilled at bunnahabhain), cask #2540, 27 year old, 1978 vintage, 54.4%",Single Malt Scotch,90,200,"very fragrant on the nose, and thick on the palate. the flavors are chock full of thick chewy toffee, chocolate fudge, roasted nuts, burnt raisin, black currant, and spiced oak. there’s a hint of salt and earl grey tea on the finish. very dynamic. 
"
"bunnahabhain 46 year old eich bhana lìr, 41.8%",Single Malt Scotch,90,"7,500","distilled in 1969, the oldest bunnahabhain ever released was matured in second-fill sherry butts. the nose yields sweet resin, marzipan, ginger, glacé cherries, a hint of cloves, and red berries. the silky palate features jaffa oranges, dark chocolate, prunes, and more glacé cherries. the finish dries steadily, with slightly bitter tea, white pepper, a savory note, and quite subtle oak tannins for a dram of this vintage. (198 bottles)"
"caol ila 12 year old feis ile bottling 2012, 60.4%",Single Malt Scotch,90,133,"often overshadowed by other noisier neighbors, it is time to reconsider caol ila—and this is a fine place to start. coming from a refill cask it has a nose of sweet crab, ham with cider glaze, and teasing maritime smoke. the palate mixes salt taffy with top-end peppery olive oil, allowing the flavors to cover the palate while the smoke rumbles along constantly before a salt-laden finish. superlative balance. find one of those 620 bottles! £85	"
"caol ila 30 year old (diageo special release 2014), 55.1%",Single Malt Scotch,90,700,"more smoke than is common from this distillery and age. the aromas are food-related: initially roast ham with caramelized sugars, then a clambake, then oven-roasted lobster. with water, a distinct whiff of the goat shed (nice, by the way). the palate is refined and mature, but with fresh fruits retained, with oak and smoke beautifully integrated. a mature caol ila in similar vein to the excellent (and significantly more keenly priced) 25 year old. (7,638 bottles)"
"adelphi (distilled at clynelish), 1989, 10 year old, 61.5%",Single Malt Scotch,90,85,"straw color. fresh, appetizing aroma. light-medium body. nicely balanced flavors. both the aroma and palate express notes of spices (dijon mustard), brine, exotic peppers, caramel, and fruit. lingering finish. 
"
"cragganmore 10 year old, 60.1%",Single Malt Scotch,90,125,"very dry, fragrant and spicy. medium bodied, but firm. initial, flirtatious notes of honey, creamy caramel and oatcakes quickly become dry and arid, with a foundation of leather and oak shavings. the whisky is peppered throughout with notes of anise, coffee, dried herbs and undertones of madeira. very forward and bullishly dry for its age, and more intense than the standard cragganmore bottling. it’s rare for a whisky this young to be so complex. 
"
"signatory 'unchillfiltered' (distilled at cragganmore), 15 year old, 1989 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,59,"independent bottlings of cragganmore are hard to come by, and this one is a beauty. cragganmore is not rich, heavy, or sweet like many speyside whiskies. this one is medium-bodied, yet firm. it is clean on the palate throughout (with a brief honeyed vanilla note before becoming dry), and it is loaded with spice and dried fruits that continue to evolve. long, lingering, finish. the decision to forego chill-filtering certainly reveals more of this whisky’s subtle, yet persistent, complexity.

"the dalmore 1979 aged 33 years, 48.5%",Single Malt Scotch,90,8000,"this expression of the dalmore constellation spent its entire 33 years of maturation in an ex-bourbon cask, with no additional finishing. the result is a nose of ripe peaches and pears, honey, and vanilla. full-bodied, rich, sweet, elegant, yet substantial on the palate, with pineapples and fudge. oak and aniseed slowly build, but the wood is held at bay. long and warming in the finish, with soft spices. barely drying. cask number 594; 199 bottles. "
"dalmore ceti 30 year old, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,90,1980,"the dalmore spirit that comprises ceti comes from a mix of bourbon and sherry casks, with bourbon wood predominating. 23 years of maturation in american oak were followed by seven years in 30 year old gonzalez byass matusalem oloroso sherry butts. the result is a nose of old leather, hessian, sandalwood, vanilla, plain chocolate, and ripe jaffa oranges. very full-bodied, with burnt orange, pineapple, and sticky toffee, while the finish offers ginger, orange wine gums, and old oak. 1,000 bottles. £1,250"
"the dalmore 25 year old, 42%",Single Malt Scotch,90,975,"dalmore 25 year old comprises spirit matured initially in american oak casks, some of which is then transferred into first-fill bourbon barrels, while the remainder goes into palomino fino sherry butts. the two batches are then reunited in bourbon barrels before a final finishing in tawny port pipes. vanilla, figs, toffee, and ripe oranges on the festive nose, while the palate features more orange, peaches, milk chocolate, and sherry. the chocolate darkens in the lengthy finish, with ginger and licorice."
"deanston 40 year old, 45.6%",Single Malt Scotch,90,1215,"this veteran expression from deanston distillery was matured in refill bourbon casks before spending no fewer than 10 years in oloroso sherry butts. rose petals, fresh pineapple, clotted cream, cinnamon, and dusty oak on the enticing nose. unctuous in the mouth, with apple pie, cinnamon, hazelnuts, and ginger. drying slowly to pleasing fruity, tannic notes. extremely long finish, with a persistent citric tang. (less than 500 bottles globally)"
"gordon & macphail (distilled at glen grant), 1966, 41 year old, 49.4%",Single Malt Scotch,90,512,"there have been a lot of old, heavily sherried, independently bottled glen grant whiskies on the market over the past several years. this one appears to be from a refill sherry cask, as its influence is more subtle. it has aged well, showing no excessive oak, but plenty of fruit (summer fruits, dried citrus, stewed fruits, tangerine, golden raisin), balanced by polished oak, grape skin, and subtle dark chocolate. distinctively pleasing. don’t add too much water, though, as it breaks down. (a kensington wine market exclusive.) $500 (cad)"
"berry brothers & rudd (distilled at glen grant) 1972 37 year old, 51.8%",Single Malt Scotch,90,289,"this is quite different from the adelphi glen grant bottling (below), being more cask-driven, but glen grant’s clean fruitiness remains, although transformed by age. its apples are baked, with some added caramelized juices thrown in; we see apricot alongside dried lemon peel, and light, sweet spice. the waxiness here is akin to leather oil, while the oak has sufficient grip to give structure. in time, there are hints of the cellar — burlap and wet earth. delicious, and best neat. £184"
"glen grant five decades, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,177,"created by dennis malcolm to celebrate his half century at glen grant, this uses casks
from each of his five decades. pale it may be, but this is no dainty little
thing. there’s lots of buttery oak before classic glen grant lift and energy
emerge: green apple, fruit blossom, william pear, and yellow fruits; lemon
butter icing and nettles with water. the palate is vibrant and energetic, but
holds to the middle of the tongue. a suitably celebratory dram.
congratulations! £115"
"glendronach, 1990 vintage, 20 year old, oloroso cask #2621, 57.9%",Single Malt Scotch,90,125,"if every fan of sherried whisky has a favorite glendronach then this is a long way down the road to being mine. it has a dusty dried orange peel, powdery, and perfumey nose, a soft and sweet round palate with a dark chocolate, tangerine, and pink grapefruit heart, and a balanced and gentle finish. this was probably once a hollerin’ maned lion of a malt, but it’s grown old gracefully and it now purrs and growls beautifully. £80 "
"glendronach cask strength (batch 6), 56.1%",Single Malt Scotch,90,71,"the latest batch of cask strength glendronach should make aberlour a’bunadh look to its laurels. it is matured in a combination of pedro ximenez and oloroso sherry casks. the nose is quite perfumed, with sweet sherry, figs, nutmeg, satsumas, and candied peel. voluptuous in the mouth, with early bright fruit notes, cinder toffee, and caramel, followed by darker sherry and raisin notes. lightly peppery and tannic, with plain chocolate. £55"

(240 bottles for the u.s.)"
"glenfarclas family cask 1971 (cask 3546), 51.1%",Single Malt Scotch,90,540,"sherry butt once more, but this is much more relaxed in its attentions — think montgomery clift seducing elizabeth taylor rather than de niro chatting up liza minelli. sweetness is the key here, gentle and slightly caramelized, with touches of molasses-like concentration and even a whiff of the top of a crème brûlée. the palate surprises with its continued freshness; apple and the distillery’s distinctive earthy richness. great balance.£382"
"glenfarclas family cask 1996 (cask 1306), 55.6%",Single Malt Scotch,90,270,"the youngest of this family cask selection shows glenfarclas in a surprisingly citric light, with plenty of citrus peels — tangerine, marmalade, and orange syrup, as well as sultana, suede, wax polish (surprising in a youngish dram), and chocolate — a recurring theme here. it is almost as if all the more lifted elements in each of the previous casks have here united. mature, but highly expressive, and a great starter.  £172"
"glenfarclas family casks 1990 cask #1362, 51.4%",Single Malt Scotch,90,379,"although the youngest of the range, this has still spent 24 years in a refill butt.  the nose is highly concentrated, with freshly-sharpened pencils and black cherry. there’s also some tobacco and then an earthy, armagnac-esque pruniness. water brings out a resinous element, supple leather, and fruit syrups, allowing it to retain complexity. the driest of the range with the most obvious grip; for lovers of big, sherried, malts. £225"
"glenfarclas 17 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,90,99,"weighty and deep. instantly seductive: vanilla pod, rich fruits, the smell of fur coats. a femme fatale of a malt. a base of crisp malt mixes with oak to give balance and structure. water brings out apple leaf, even a little grassiness. the palate is broad and balanced, with real sweetness and a tongue-coating quality which softens to dried fruit, earthy density, with a whiff of smoke. redolent with the aroma of a dunnage warehouse. a class act."
"glenfarclas 50 year old, 41.1%",Single Malt Scotch,90,2339,"just pause for a moment before tasting. 50 years. what has happened in the world during that time? how have you changed? what has it done to the whisky? added a quiet elegance. it brings to mind elements of long-dried concentrated fruit and nut, damson, even smoke. the tannins are initially dusty, but a splash of water adds a fresh potpourri perfume. is it expensive? for something that’s spent 50 years in a cask? no, it isn’t. (937 bottles) £1800"
"glen garioch 1986, 54.6%",Single Malt Scotch,90,185,"this latest vintage release from glen garioch is a cask strength 25 year old. it follows on from previous ‘small-batch’ 1978, 1990, 1991, and 1994 vintages. peaches and ginger on the nose, with fudge and a wisp of smoke. mildly herbal. full-bodied, rich, and sweet in the mouth. fresh fruit and violet creams. finally a slightly earthy, peaty note. the finish is long and gently smoky. robust, yet refined."

"glengoyne christmas cask, 60.6%",Single Malt Scotch,90,155,"credit to glengoyne for coming up with something different. there are just 100 bottles of this malt available this year, with a further 100 or so released each christmas from the same cask each year until 2014, effectively offering malt enthusiasts the chance to plot a work in progress. better still, this first effort is one of the best releases ever to come out of the distillery.
the name is spot on; it really is christmas in a glass, with the almost feminine aromas of rosewater, flowers, candy stick, and fruit giving way to a huge sherry note on the palate. dark chocolate, cherry, orange, and chili notes combine to offer up a bold and full malt. some special bottlings from glengoyne have been over-oaky or marred by sulfur, but not this one. this is clean, pure, and classy. can’t wait to see where it goes next.
"
"glengoyne 25 year old, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,90,421,"the latest addition to glengoyne’s permanent range is a 25 year old, matured in european oak sherry casks and presented in non-chill filtered format. syrup-like on the nose, very sweet, with milk chocolate, ginger, jaffa oranges, and sticky toffee pudding. smooth and sweet on the palate, with overt sherry, sultanas, and gentle spice. the finish is medium to long, with a hint of oak, old leather, and lingering cloves. bold, yet elegant. £250"

"
"the glenlivet nàdurra, 16 year old, 57.2%",Single Malt Scotch,90,60,"aged exclusively in first-fill bourbon casks and bottled unfiltered and at natural cask strength. this takes the usually subtle glenlivet and makes it more vibrant, amplifying its flavors while accentuating the bourbon oak. tight notes of honeyed malt, vanilla bean, toasted oak, bright fruit, and nuts, are peppered with more subtle floral and spice notes. dry, spicy finish. a glenlivet with pizzazz."
"the glenlivet french oak, 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,90,36,"antique amber color. this whisky maintains the elegance cherished by glenlivet enthusiasts, but finishing the whisky in limousin oak produces a whisky of deeper wood notes, particularly wood spices (vanilla, sandalwood, perhaps even mint) and floral notes. it’s rich, complex, and dry-especially on the finish. 
"
"duncan taylor (distilled at glenlivet) 1968 vintage, 35 year old, 43.1% abv",Single Malt Scotch,90,155,"younger bottlings of glenlivet are often quite elegant and subtle. but such finesse isn’t always evident in older expressions, which often become dominated by sherry and oak. this one, at 35 years of age, demonstrates plenty of elegance and finesse. what impresses me most about this whisky is that you wouldn’t know it was 35 year old just by taste. it isn’t the least bit tired on the palate, and it is very clean, without the excessive woodiness often found in whiskies of this age. plus, the balance of flavors is impeccable-vanilla, honeyed malt, peaches, pineapple, heather, and just a touch of oak. a very polished, refined whisky. 
"
"gordon & macphail generations: the glenlivet 70 year old, 45.9%",Single Malt Scotch,90,21000,"you would expect any 70 year old whisky to be crepuscular, dense, and wooded. not here. the nose is amazingly fresh — distillery character fully intact — with layers of rancio and heavy florals. in time, there’s candle wax, vanilla, milk chocolate, and a touch of leather, even the whiff of a soft mink stole. concentrated and complex. the palate is like an ancient vin santo with oxidized nuttiness, quince and medlar, and subtle peat. hugely expressive on the palate, with a sweet finish. truly remarkable. "

a first-fill american oak hoggie was the receptacle for the representative from the 1960s. the cask has provided an extremely relaxed environment for maturation to take place, with a return of the pineapple (grilled on a barbecue this time), along with linden blossom, cream, green jasmine tea, and mint. the effect is like a grown up 1991. the maturity kicks in on the palate — thick and slow with some sandalwood alongside honeysuckle. gentle and clean, and again not one to dilute. £750"
"glenmorangie margaux cask finish, 18 year old, 1987 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,450,"waves of fruit (apple pie, orange marmalade, sultana, ripe pineapple), accented with notes of dark chocolate, roasted nuts, and spice (cinnamon, vanilla, ginger, evergreen), particularly on the finish. (in the past, i’ve thought that a couple of these limited edition glemorangie wood finishes were a little overdone with the finishing, but not this one). 
"
"glenmorangie 1981 sauternes, wood finish, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,300,"style: highland single malt scotch color: golden honey aroma: lush and mouthwatering. notes of honey, peaches in syrup, golden raisins, coconut, vanilla, and background resinous oak. palate: creamy and velvety in texture. honey and fruit up front, with some oak notes, wood resins and vanilla mid-palate, becoming sweet again with a soothing finish. 
"
"glenmorangie sonnalta px, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,70,"the first of glenmorangie’s new “private collection” line of whiskies for travel retail. this one is finished in pedro ximenez (px) sherry. with px being so rich and intense, and glenmorangie spirit so subtly complex and delicate, does the sherry dominate here? no, it doesn’t. still, this is viscous and very textural for a glenmorangie. i’m picking up rhum agricole drenched with honeyed apricot, toffee almond, chocolate-covered raisin, glazed citrus, and cherry pits, all leading to a leathery, tobacco-tinged finish. a visceral whisky with plenty of grip. great for after dinner."
"glenmorangie ealanta private edition, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,119,"ealanta is the fourth release in glenmorangie’s private edition series, and has been aged in heavily-charred virgin white oak casks from missouri for nineteen years. the result is a nose of american cream soda, milk chocolate, fudge, pineapple, and honey; spicy and creamy. silky smooth in the mouth, with brittle toffee and orange notes; gently herbal, with a suggestion of cloves and newly-sawn wood. long in the finish, with citrus fruit, oak, aniseed, and an enduring spicy creaminess.  "
"glenmorangie companta, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,99,"companta—gaelic for friendship—is the fifth of glenmorangie’s private edition releases. it comprises a blend of whiskies finished in clos de tart grand cru wine casks and in fortified wine casks from côtes du rhône. big fruity, leathery notes on the nose. spicy, with sultanas, almonds, and icing sugar. the palate is rich and complex, with cocoa powder, nutmeg, more leather, and redcurrants. long and fruity in the finish, with vibrant spices. red berries predominate."

"
"the glenrothes, 1979 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,90,70,"amber color. lush, rich aromas of rummy toffee, nuts, vanilla, with interwoven notes of glazed fruit. on the heavy side of medium in body, and silky. there are layers of sweetness on the palate (toffee, caramel, marzipan and dates), becoming nutty with a pleasing oak woodiness to balance the sweetness. long, dryish finish with notes of spice and fruit. 
"
"duncan taylor peerless (distilled at glenrothes) 1969 41 year old, 44.2%",Single Malt Scotch,90,330,"immediately you can tell this is a complex, old, mature whisky — that hint of rancio is there, but there’s more of a beeswax character than on the adelphi bottling (below), along with the peachiness that often appears in old drams. this is balanced by light coconut, even a hint of grist. the waxiness seen on the nose allows it to cling to the tongue, while the fruits become jellied. benefits from a drop of water, allowing lemon and vanilla to show. £210"
"glenrothes minister’s reserve, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,90,188,"the oldest of a new three-strong range from glenrothes called the manse brae series; the youngest component here is 21 years old. serious and lightly meaty, the savory characters come at you, mixing gun smoke with cypress, sandalwood, dark chocolate, and dunnage warehouse. the headiness of moist forest floor continues on the tongue along with a burst of honeyed peach. moving in many directions simultaneously…and slowly. keep this neat. classic rothes. (travel retail exclusive.) €140"
"highland park 15 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,90,60,"a new expression due out in march, positioned between the 12 and 18 year old versions. a fresh and enormously drinkable whisky; very silky, with honeyed malt, delicate citrus and berry fruit, floral notes (heather and lavender), and a hint of cocoa and sea spray. 
"
"highland park 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,90,46,"highland park 12 year old boasts individuality and complexity, thanks in part to the use of orcadian peat in the distillery floor maltings and the employment of ex-sherry casks for maturation. the nose is fragrant and floral, with hints of heather and some spice. smooth and honeyed on the palate, with citrus fruits, malt, and distinctive tones of wood smoke in the warm, lengthy, slightly peaty finish."
"highland park thor 16 year old, 52.1%",Single Malt Scotch,90,200,"thor is the first in highland park’s new cask strength valhalla collection, with a fresh expression inspired by the nordic gods due to be released annually over the next four years. ginger, sherry, christmas spices, wood smoke, vanilla, and a hint of lemon on the complex, confident nose. notably spicy in the mouth, with peaches, clotted cream, sherry, and more smoke. long in the finish, with lots of ginger, a little aniseed, and finally, spicy peat.  "
"highland park fire, 45.2%",Single Malt Scotch,90,300,"fire is the first highland park expression to be fully matured in “refill port wine-seasoned casks” and it carries a 15 year age statement. very fruity on the nose—raspberries and prunes —plus lightly-smoked pineapple and vanilla. more smoky, spicy fruit features on the palate, with a light sprinkling of cinnamon. the peat dries to leave ashy licorice and black pepper in a lingering finish. the port is pleasingly discreet. (4,938 bottles for the u.s.)"
"jura 1977 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,900,"this vintage expression from jura has been matured in three first-fill bourbon casks and then finished for one year in a ruby port pipe. just 498 bottles have been released. apricots, pineapple, caramel, butterscotch, sultanas, and white chocolate on the nose. the palate is warm and spicy, with subtle pine and citrus fruits, along with coconut and a hint of peat. long in the finish with more vanilla before dried fruits and oak kick in. the delicate peat remains."
"lagavulin, 12 year old (2009 release), 57.9% ",Single Malt Scotch,90,75,"the aromas are tightly bound, but a little water releases them nicely. a powerful dram, with tarry, leafy, coal ash, caramel apple, and driftwood notes; even a little soapy (not necessarily a negative). more subtle floral notes (heather, violet), earl grey tea, and smoked fish. long, damp peat smoke and charcoal finish.
"
"lagavulin 18 year old fèis ìle 2016 bottling, 49.5%",Single Malt Scotch,90,162,"it’s been quite a year for lagavulin; a 25 year old is due (but no sample at the time of writing). this was a 6,000-strong bottling, aged in refill hoggies and ‘bodega’ butts. initially restrained and mildly oxidized, it shows angelica, a spritz of lemon juice on potted shrimp, then fennel pollen and water mint. the smoke is pulled back. the palate has orchard fruits, creosote, and moss. lagavulin’s top notes accentuated, but with the depth of age. £125"
"laphroaig, 18 year old, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,90,90,"very smooth for laphroaig -- the extra aging has mellowed this whisky. soothing honeyed malt, creamy vanilla, and toffee provide a bed for peat smoke, charcoal, and tar; along with more subtle brine, smoked seaweed, anise, ginger, and citrus. a gentler, creamier, more tactile, less medicinal laphroaig when compared to some of its siblings. will you prefer the new 18 year old to the 15 year old it is replacing? that depends. i enjoy the balance and subtle complexity of flavors with the 15 year old, but i also like the enhanced richness and mouth-coating creaminess of the 18. the higher strength (and no chill-filtering) of the 18 is certainly a bonus. (side note: i know this is a moot point now, but i would like to have seen the 15 year old bottled at 48%, rather than 43%.)"
"laphroaig triple wood, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,90,100,"similar to laphroaig quarter cask, but also finished in oloroso sherry casks. fruit and smoke: fleshy red berries, red licorice, toffee, ripe barley, coal tar, sun-baked seaweed, peat smoke, and a hint of coffee grounds. tarry finish. i rated the quarter cask a 91, and i think this whisky is similar in quality. if you like sherry-influenced whiskies, then go for the triple wood. if not, then consider the quarter cask. (currently exclusive to travel retail and european specialist retailers.)"
"laphroaig 32 year old, 46.5%",Single Malt Scotch,90,1500,"a (very) special anniversary bottling, this is old-style, brooding laphroaig. fully mature and rich, it shows that classic roiling mass of kelp, oil, and brine, always balanced by sweetness: in this case autumn berry fruits. malt adds a crunchiness. the palate is gentle and slow with the characteristic camphoraceous lift of bog myrtle on the back palate, which is all that remains of the smoke. pricey, yes, but rare. get saving!"
"loch lomond 18 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,99,"the 18 year old is loch lomond’s flagship single malt and marks the improvement in quality from this distillery during recent years. the nose offers peaches and vanilla, mild spice, pipe tobacco, and a hint of sweet wood smoke. nicely textured, with bold, sweet, citrus fruit flavors, vanilla, almonds, and cocoa. nutty, gently spicy, with cocoa and a hint of coffee in the lengthy, subtly peated finish."

"
"macallan easter elchies, 52.3%",Single Malt Scotch,90,185,"this is like a blast from the past, with much in common with the sherried cask strength of old, and a welcome treat for any fan of the big, sherried macallans. all the red berry and blood orange notes are present on the nose, along with cocoa and a dusty smokiness. the palate is full, velvety and chewy, with christmas cake, oranges, and some nuttiness. nutmeg and cinnamon fill out the mouth feel, before a long and classic sherried finish. "
"gordon & macphail (distilled at macallan) 1970 41 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,90,700,"on more familiar ground with this g&m bottling of one of speyside’s most iconic single malts, this is macallan in full-on sherried form. highly aromatic with powdered clove, hints of incense and fig, behind which is cacao, bolivar cigar, and molasses. the palate has immediate smoke and surprisingly gentle tannins — the inherent oiliness of the spirit keeping any grip at bay. very long, leathery, prune-like (think armagnac), and dense. a classic after-dinner mouth-filler."
"adelphi (distilled at macallan) 14 year old 1997, 51.6%",Single Malt Scotch,90,117,"here is macallan in full-blown masculine mode. initially it seems tight and (sherry) cask driven, but soon you are taken into a winter kitchen with scents of venison, and appropriate rowanberry edges adding a sweet and sour fruitiness. that wild berry note is given another nudge by a whiff of burning juniper. the palate shows it to be thick with a quivering mass of black fruits, and a finish of molasses and licorice. a feast. £75"
"macallan ruby, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,90,187,"rooted in the earth and redolent of late autumn. there’s a plummy thread that runs through this range; here we’ve gone to prune, mixed with dried cherries, and a sweet/savory edge whose whiff of heavy rose petal is reminiscent of barolo. robust, yet sweet. heady, like chocolate-covered turkish delight. the palate has oloroso notes alongside assam-like tannins. one to have with water on the side. classical in structure and aromatics, but that vinous sweetness is new.  £120"
"the macallan double cask 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,90,65,"this straddles the existing sherry oak and fine oak ranges by being a mix of spirit matured in both european and american oak sherry casks. earthy sherry and old leather on the nose, with toffee, polished oak, and cherry blossom. medium to full-bodied, with sherry, orange, cocoa, nutty vanilla, and developing wood spices on the honeyed palate. the finish is creamy, with insistent spices, cocoa, and tangy oak."
"the macallan edition no. 2, 48.2%",Single Malt Scotch,90,105,"this limited release was aged in seven cask types—both american and european oak in a variety of sizes—from four spanish bodegas: vasyma, diego martin, jose miguel martin, and tevasa. citrus fruits, ginger, black pepper, light smoke, and rubbery leather on the nose. ultimately, carnations. the palate is rich, nutty, and sweet, with malt, toffee, sticky sherry, maraschino cherries, milk chocolate, and gentle spice. long in the finish, with spices and creamy cocoa."
"macallan edition no.3, 48.3%",Single Malt Scotch,90,95,"the third release in macallan’s annual edition series—which focuses on aspects of cask influence—was matured in a mix of european and american oak casks. figs and apricot jam, vanilla, jaffa oranges, and cinnamon on the nose. the palate is silky and offers a big citrus fruit hit, bit-o-honey, then creamy milk chocolate. milk chocolate persists through the long, fruity finish, with attendant sweet oak."
"adelphi (distilled at mortlach) 25 year old, 59.4%",Single Malt Scotch,90,157,"rich amber in hue, sweet, and mellow with initial amontillado sherry notes that give way to mortlach meatiness; here a lamb tagine with prune, apricot, and gravy juices. this elegance gives way to a fascinating palate mix of the sweet and the savory with citrus, sultana, and a rowanberry jab on the end mingling with just a bit of smoke. everything mellowed by time and oak. very good indeed. £99"
"mortlach rare old, 43.4%",Single Malt Scotch,90,93,"the introductory expression of the range shows a further example of the widening of the mortlach style. stewed and dried fruits mingle with light earth notes, wet labrador, supple shoe leather, and varnish. a drop of water is all that’s needed to add a savory element and even some funky fruitiness reminiscent of cooking agave. the palate is big and chocolaty with some meat underneath. hefty but elegant. the distillery character is not only intact, but enhanced. £55/500 ml"
"mortlach special strength, 49%",Single Malt Scotch,90,127,"this is rare old at higher strength for folks who haunt travel retail outlets. the upping of strength also changes the dynamic, making things sweeter with mushed berries and seville orange, but also deeper, with more overt meatiness, stewed tea, and the same varnished note. dense, thick, stewed orchard fruits are on the palate alongside some acetone and, with water, burning rosemary and dry licorice. similar, but with more heft. £75/500 ml"
"port ellen, 1979 vintage, 28 year old, 53.8%",Single Malt Scotch,90,300,"the seventh limited edition release of port ellen whiskies by diageo. not as vibrant and intense as younger bottlings (particularly on the nose), but nicely matured with a satisfying sweet foundation. notes of toffee and roasted nuts permeate though the peat kiln smoke, coal tar, fish nets, and charred oak. seaweed and brine, more reserved mid-palate, emerges noticeably on the finish. the port ellen bottlings are getting older (the distillery closed in 1983) and they are getting more expensive. this one still captures the essence of port ellen. 
"
"old malt cask (distilled at port ellen), 25 year old, 54.7%",Single Malt Scotch,90,256,"these port ellen whiskies are becoming increasingly rare since the distillery closed down for good in 1983. this is a very good example of an old-fashioned islay whisky: never heavy, but with lots of kick. there’s plenty of wet leaf, bonfire smoke, coal tar, and some earthy, damp kiln notes and brine. but you’ll discover a lovely honeyed maltiness for balance, along with tangerine, dirty martini, and cocoa for complexity. smoky, briny finish. there will be a time when some of us will tell the next generation of whisky drinkers about the joys of port ellen. mare sure you’re one of those telling the story, not listening to it. (exclusive to kensington wine market.) $250 (canadian)"
"signatory (distilled at port ellen), 1982 vintage, 26 year old (cask # 1202), 54.1%",Single Malt Scotch,90,275,"port ellen, for sure! very old-fashioned in nature: intertwined notes of tarry rope, coal soot, rooty peat, toffee, dark chocolate, and walnuts, spiked with coffee bean, anise, cracked peppercorn, and a hint of ginger. dry, smoky, long, slightly austere finish. this port ellen is a bit moody (maybe even has an attitude problem), but i’m not complaining."
"duncan taylor (distilled at springbank) 13 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,100,"recently bottled by duncan taylor in their non-colored, non-chill filtered nc2 range, this 13 year old expression of springbank initially exhibits tinned pears on the nose, then smoked fish cooked in butter, coconut oil, brine, and a hint of lemon. more sweet wood smoke with time, turning to char. the palate opens with profound, sweet fruit, swiftly followed by salt, lime, and medicinal notes. lingering, with ginger in the pleasantly oaky finish. £64"
"springbank 21 year old 2014 release, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,307,"the latest limited release of 21 year old springbank has been matured in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. sherry and bourbon notes are well integrated on the early nose, which follows up with succulent tropical fruits, toffee, and a whiff of earthy peat. the palate is complex, confident, and oily, with dry sherry notes, almonds, figs, vanilla, wood smoke, and a hint of the sea. the lengthy finish boasts caramel, cinnamon, brine, and soft peat. £182"
"peerless (distilled at strathisla) 1967, 35 year old, 48.8%",Single Malt Scotch,90,160,"antique gold color. a pleasingly aromatic aroma of dried fruit, floral notes, malt, and light toffee. medium in body, and slightly chewy. its flavors are well-balanced, deep, and complex. toffee, almonds, and sweet malt notes, with interwoven notes of fruit. the palate ultimately dries out with dried fruit, herbs and nuts on the finish. 
"
"strathisla 16 year old, 55.3%",Single Malt Scotch,90,59,"this is one of a trio from chivas bros., who every year release limited editions of 500 ml cask strength bottlings from a selection of its estates. these are predominantly only for sale on site or by mail order through www.maltwhiskydistilleries.com.

my pick of this batch. strathisla’s a small, traditional distillery whose make is mostly pressed into service for the chivas regal blends. it’s a hard to pin down malt, and it’s this elusive character that shows here: firm then soft, fragrant then deep. the nose is intense and spicy with wax, nougat, chocolate, hazelnut, and fresh-opened banana. the palate is explosive with real presence and power, whose firm core is softened by honey and poached fruits. complex is the word. £37"
"talisker 10 year old, 45.8%",Single Malt Scotch,90,50,"fresh, vibrant. appetizingly briny, with notes of seaweed, fishnets, lemongrass, smoke, and damp peat. a bed of light toffee provides contrast and balance. it finishes with a knockout punch: powerfully peppery and salty. this whisky remains a beautifully dynamic and bold whisky. 
"
"talisker distillers edition, 1992 vintage, 45.6%",Single Malt Scotch,90,65,"matured in amoroso casks. the amoroso softens talisker’s fiery personality and adds a gentle sweetness not normally found in talisker. there’s a lot going on here-notes of toffee and dark chocolate, layered with bitter orange, seaweed, kippers, smoked nuts, damp peat, and kalamata olives, finishing with a peppery glow. not an every day dram-one has to be in the mood for a whisky like this. (with sausages during brunch, perhaps?) 
"
"talisker 30 year old, 57.3%",Single Malt Scotch,90,349,"for me, talisker 30 year olds have paled in comparison to the same distillery’s 20 and 25 year olds. this, however, immediately shows promise. gold in color, and while it’s another one that starts ever so slightly restrained, the giveaway peppery note soon reveals itself as smoked pimento and szechuan pepper, mixed with extra virgin olive oil spread over hot smoked salmon. there’s also a touch of putty — something which you usually only see in youthful expressions — suggesting that here’s another refill maturation. 
as with many of these older whiskies, water isn’t the best option for the palate, but a drop does help release the sweet fruitiness that always lurks in talisker’s heart, this time accompanied by an herbal note (mint and fennel). it’s almost as if it is looking back at itself as an 18 year old, but here the firm granitic grip of age takes hold.
the palate starts slowly but opens well with a gentle, yet assertive revealing of the aromas on the nose. it seems to dip in energy just in the center before sparking back to life when the smoke emerges, like the last flash of defiance from an old-timer. "
"talisker 10 year old, 45.8%",Single Malt Scotch,90,50,"another that should need no introduction. the thing to look for in talisker, as with all smoky whiskies, is sweetness that gives the requisite balance to the drying effect of smoke. underneath talisker’s smoke, which ain't as all-pervading as lagavulin, is a sweet pear-like quality. when young there are notes of the land: heather, moor, sweet seaweed, and a finish that has a distinctive cracked black pepper hit."
"duncan taylor (distilled at tamdhu), cask # 7313, 34 year old, 1969 vintage, 40.2%",Single Malt Scotch,90,250,"a whisky that defies its age. it is remarkably clean and fresh, with no suggestion of excessive oak. fragrant aroma, with notes of vanilla, coconut, honeyed malt, cereal grain, and linseed. similar follow through on the palate, with a texture that is soft, lightly oily, and soothing. clean finish. one of the best tamdhu whiskies i’ve tasted. 
"
"tamdhu batch strength, 58.8%",Single Malt Scotch,90,88,"ian macleod’s first release of tamdhu was a belter. now, finally, it’s been joined by this high-strength nas. there’s no hint of the high strength on the nose, which is all caramel toffee and shortbread, backed with sultana-like sherry cask influence. the palate is the same: nut, dark fruits, and date. hugely approachable. with water, it’s a matter of…chocolate? maltesers! all you want in a sherried whisky, and it won’t burn a hole in your wallet either. £60"
"tomintoul stillman's dram, 33 year old, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,90,230,"antique gold color. fragrant aroma, with floral notes, soft honey tones, vanilla, and delicate fruit (orange and lemon). light to medium in body and soft in texture. flavors are similar to the whisky's aroma, very clean, and with great balance-the woody notes one would expect from a whisky this old are kept in check."
"tomintoul 25 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,90,415,"this is the oldest core expression of tomintoul’s gentle dram, now available in the u.s. it is a classic of this style of speyside single malt. peaches, malt, honey, vanilla, and developing floral notes on the nose. full-bodied, with ripe apples, cocoa, milky coffee, honey, vanilla, and soft spices. spicy and drying, with plain chocolate in the relatively lengthy, mellow finish."
"scott's selection (distilled at 'north of scotland'), 1964 vintage, 45.5%",Grain Scotch Whisky,90,140,"according to the christie family who owned north of scotland distillery before it was sold to dcl in 1982 (and closed it shortly thereafter,) they would purchase the least expensive grain possible to make their grain whisky. in 1964, it was barley. the barley, combined with the fact that the whisky is finished off in port casks, makes for a surprisingly rich, sweet, and fruity grain whisky, expressing notes of demerara sugar, perfumed candles, cherry almond tart, caramel and vanilla. remarkably restrained wood notes for such a mature whisky, which expresses itself mostly in its soft, creamy finish. unique among whiskies. 
"
"cutty sark prohibition, 50%",Blended Scotch Whisky,90,30,"the real mccoy! it's said that during prohibition bill mccoy serviced the better speakeasies with proper cutty sark; hence the name. if this is a recreation of what they might have been drinking back then, you can see why they kept fighting over it. this is another bold, earthy, smoky blend with oily, industrial notes. there's crabapple, smoke, bitter lemon, grapefruit, and even black currant. it would seem blended whisky is where it's at right now! great stuff.  "
"cutty sark art deco limited edition 33 year old, 41.7%",Blended Scotch Whisky,90,989,"imagine sipping this sophisticated libation at the supper club turned out in your best bib and tucker. there’s a purity to it, with aromas of fresh red apples, raisins in honey, ground cinnamon, and nutmeg, leading to bitter orange oils and a storm of black pepper fading to tropical fruit, layered caramel, and sugared almonds. hold this long in the mouth, as it possesses a changing, multi-faceted character. as cab calloway said, “this is hep.” (3,456 bottles) £650"
"port askaig 15 year old sherry cask, 45.8%",Single Malt Scotch,90,109,"matured in first-fill oloroso sherry casks, this is 20% peated whisky from 1997 and 80% fruitier whisky distilled in 2001. earthy on the early nose, with bonfire smoke, vanilla, raisins, and prunes. the palate opens with sweet fruit notes and medium-dry sherry, giving way to nutmeg, brine, and peat. the finish features plain chocolate, bitter lemons, and a hint of smoky chili. £85"
"kilchoman, autumn 2009 release, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,76,"this (rather young) islay distillery’s second release. like the first, it’s aged for about three years and then finished in sherry casks—this time for a shorter two and a half months. its flavor is similar to the first release.
once again, i am quite impressed. it’s very mature for its age, with good viscosity, showing smoldering peat, coal tar, black licorice stick, burnt dark berried fruit, thick-cut marmalade, shoo-fly pie (think molasses), toffee apple, cocoa powder, cinnamon, and a suggestion of wet sheep. long, peat smoke finish.£47
"
"kilchoman loch gorm 2017, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,100,"this is the sixth—and oldest—limited annual release of loch gorm, distilled in 2009 and aged in oloroso sherry butts. the nose is earthy, with raisins, dry spices, smoldering peat, and a not unpleasing hint of rubber. the palate is lively with spices, sherry, cherries, and iodine-soaked peats. aniseed, sweet sherried peat, and tingling spices in the medium-length finish. (13,500 bottles)"
"berry bros. & rudd, distilled at balmenach, 1979, 56.3%",Single Malt Scotch,90,232,"although one of the old speyside crew (along with mortlach, glenfarclas, and macallan) balmenach has, inexplicably in my mind, never even achieved cult status. it has simply kept on making rich, powerful, worm tub-condensed spirit for a multitude of blends. this rare bottling therefore is hugely welcome and shows a friskier than usual side — earthy for sure and a lick of leather as well, but also walnut and sultana. the palate is deep and languorous with a savory edge. £145 (not available in the u.s.)"
"glen moray 18 year old, 47.2%",Single Malt Scotch,90,90,"this offers a slightly oily nose, with orchard fruits, vanilla, cocoa powder, nutmeg, cucumber sprinkled with white pepper, and very subtle smoke. powerful flavors of peppery fruit and malt on the palate, with honey, butterscotch, milk chocolate, cinnamon, and mellow oak. the finish is lengthy and redolent of toffee apples."
"glen moray 15 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,90,55,"aged in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks; the nose is initially relatively reticent, slightly earthy, with a hint of drinking chocolate, emerging sherry notes, and subtle orange. toffee, more chocolate, and spicy dried fruits on the relatively full-bodied palate. long in the finish, with wood spices."
"fettercairn fior, 42%",Single Malt Scotch,90,59,"released with no age statement, fettercairn fior contains 15 percent heavily-peated whisky matured in first-fill ex-bourbon barrels, along with a proportion of 14 and 15 year old spirit. the result is a bold and complex whisky with real nose presence; smoke, sherry, toffee, vanilla, and oranges merge on the nose, while the palate showcases more smoke and toffee, plus spices, oak, and licorice in the lengthy finish. £36 not currently available in the u.s."
"convalmore 36 year old, 58%",Single Malt Scotch,90,936,"the last official convalmore remains one of my top whiskies. here is a different meditation on age. there’s soft leather, coal smoke, and polished brass. the distillery’s waxiness is a spent candle in a deserted chapel, the harvest festival fruits wrinkling on the altar. amazingly, in the mouth a shaft of honeyed sunlight comes through to transform the scene into one of life. everything glows, the wax returns, and then, with the smoke increasing, the light fades. old, and fascinating. (2,980 bottles)"
"ballantine’s limited, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,90,229,"if willy wonka was ever inclined to condense a knickerbocker glory into a dram, it would nose and taste like this: caramel toffee, hints of cocoa, peeled banana, chewy marshmallows, cream, and gooey fudge sauce. the palate has banana, slightly burnt caramel, poached pear, and banoffee pie layered over mixed peel flavors, adding to its delicious appeal. it’s sweet, dry, smooth, and comforting, like that final satisfying mouthful drained from a mug of hot chocolate. comfort food for thirsty people."
"blue hanger 9th release, 45.6%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,115,"you have to take your hat off to berry bros. & rudd’s doug mcivor, who is whisky's answer to bruce springsteen: consistently brilliant, complex, spanning the generations, and in the form of his life. this just doesn't let up, with plenty of smoke and peat in the mix, but with citrus fruits, some plummy depths, and a vanilla cushion. it’s balanced perfectly. born to run? you betcha."
"clan denny islay, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,45,"it's not made clear which islay malts are included in this blended malt, but whoever's responsible for this has brought the big guns. this successfully pulls off an intense one-two, with hard hitting islay peat and brine on the one hand, and some rich sweetness on the other, making for a mouth-coatingly rich and intense whisky. the malts pack down together like a rugby scrum and combine with impressive intensity. €36"
"duncan taylor the big smoke 60, 60%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,85,"does it do exactly what it says on the tin? you betcha! this is big, and it's smoky, and if you're a fan of islay malts, then it's right up your street. there's more to it than just smoke, though. there's stewed apple on the nose as well as steam engine oil, and on the palate there's gooseberry, spearmint, and apple pip. but as you'd expect, the peat lingers. "
"douglas laing big peat, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,55,"so which independent bottler comes out in the 'big' battle of the islay blended malts? given this is bottled at a lower strength and it's at a lower price, i'm calling it a draw. the latest batch of this is the best yet, with ardbeg, caol ila, and bowmore the main components, although there is also some port ellen in the mix. so you know what to expect—and it doesn't disappoint. big and peaty."
"big peat christmas edition 2014, 55.7%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,70,"brace yourself. this takes peat to the extreme, conjuring up a moist, chocolate slab of peat being cut and lifted out of the bog. so smoky, you will feel like you’re breathing in the dense clouds rising above the smoldering kilns. a punchy thwack of peat at full strength, and even if you cut it with water, it only highlights salty fishboxes and some buttery caramels cowering from the backdraft. a deliberately singular character, but utterly brilliant nonetheless. £46"
"rare cask reserves blended reserve 26 year old, 42%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,399,"william grant & sons will be releasing a series of ghosted reserves in the years ahead, drawing on their remaining stock from closed distilleries. here, brian kinsman has used whisky from ladyburn and inverleven to create a nose of zesty key lime pie, peach, butter mintoes, and sweet oak. it is truly moreish, with creamy, malty flavors of sweet mandarin, marzipan, and strawberry with a chalky mouthfeel of candy sticks that lingers through the finish. exceptionally good whisky. (6,000 bottles)"
"house of hazelwood 25 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,90,150,"toasty granola, rye crackers, barley sugar sweetness, and murray mints make for a balanced nose on this top-of-the-range blend representing the art deco elegance of 1920s shanghai. a gloriously thick texture of rich citrus blossoms bolstered by toffee, lime, pineapple, tropical fruits, and vanilla sugar. mr. kinsman has engineered methodical and well-paced complexity here, with emergent little lights of spiciness. a long-lasting, deep orange buzz and dimming spice round off proceedings. a precious joy indeed. £115 travel retail exclusive"
"chapter 7 (undisclosed highland distillery), 55.8%",Single Malt Scotch,90,180,"swiss-based chapter 7 released this 19 year old single malt, a marriage of two sherry butts (#796 and #1,476). malt, sweet sherry, cocktail cherries, milky coffee, and a slightly earthy undertone on the nose. very rich on the palate, with chewy-sweet soft fruits, notably strawberries, syrup sponge, and lively fruit spices. mouth-drying in the long finish, with aniseed and wood spice. (1,076 bottles)"
" that boutique-y whisky company blended whisky no.1 50 year old, 46.6%",Blended Scotch Whisky,90,200,"ovaltine, whoppers, worn leather, antique furniture, medjool dates, and black fruits on the nose. sipping this whisky is an unexpected delight. given the olfactory cues of advanced maturity, it’s surprisingly nimble and still light on its toes. a charming opening of crumble filling with red currant, cranberry, raspberry, and strawberry, joined by apple, pear, and sultana, with peppery spice. chili heat and spicy finish. (batch 6; 2,000 bottles)"
"that boutique-y whisky company (distilled at north british) 27 year old, 56.3%",Grain Scotch Whisky,90,51,"this slippery little rogue exudes sweet popcorn, lemon peel, summer florals, linseed, and quaker oats pillows adrift in a sea of butterscotch sauce. rather tasty; the cask strength alcohol rips through the juicy mandarin and toffee opening, overcoming an active peppery middle section, then relinquishing its grip to leave herbal notes, corn, and fudge. reverberating lengthy toffee and spice finish. water brings out more cereal notes and soft orange."
"douglas laing provenance (distilled at glenrothes) 10 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,104,"deep amber. big, resinous, and almost heathery, with significant cask influence for a decade-old dram. the aroma is like a cobbler’s workshop: oils, leather, grease, polish, and then licorice. on the palate, there’s the prune notes of armagnac, the sweetness and cedar flavors of old rum, and very rothes-esque spiciness. water, just a drop, lightens it a little, allowing the underlying sweetness to show. not cask dominated, just bottled at exactly the right moment. recommended. £68"
"douglas laing old particular (distilled at glenrothes) 17 year old, 48.4%",Single Malt Scotch,90,117,"light gold. a beautiful oxidized note, with soft fruitcake, steamed pudding, a little hint of overripe fruits, and sweet spices. as it opens, there’s barley sugar sweets, then custard tart with nutmeg, clover honey, and marzipan. complex, in other words. water shows how well-layered it is. it starts sweetly in the mouth with a thick, honeyed texture, which becomes more delicate with water. elegant, long, and a great example of mature ’rothes. £80"
"douglas laing old particular (distilled at miltonduff) 22 year old, 51.5%",Single Malt Scotch,90,127,"immediate rancio notes, with some hazelnut and cheese rind. added oxidative notes of nuts moves things into brandy de jerez territory. sumptuous stuff, with miltonduff’s floral character adding a delicate top note, something which is enhanced with water. the tannins are light, allowing a silky feel to predominate, with just enough of a bitter edge to add interest. very good indeed. £81"
"douglas laing xtra old particular (distilled at strathclyde) 40 year old, 55.4%",Grain Scotch Whisky,90,390,"this is an amazing link back to glasgow in the 1970s. fresh peach, cherry blossom, red tunes, baked apple, hay bales, acetone, orange peel, and old pepper grinders. a silky texture with red apple, orange oils, and a luxuriantly refined taste leads to apple peelings, caramel, and ginger. such quality! the finish slips away quietly: melon, peach, fudge, and a final twist of pepper. bliss! great to see douglas laing bringing out more xop single grains of such standing. (150 bottles)"
"scallywag cask strength, 53.6%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,90,76,"as if this cheeky devil from douglas laing wasn’t good enough already! strawberry napoleon, mint leaves rubbed between finger and thumb, runny honey, fresh peach, and wood whittled on the back porch. the sweet orange starts gossamer light, then it hits the gas: the citrus becomes more tangy, touching blood orange, fizzy sweeties become taffy candy, then sherbet. eventually pacified, it becomes milky and sweet, with milk chocolate melting on the tongue. a creamy finish like a mother’s embrace. £50"
"the exclusive malts (distilled at glen garioch) 20 year old 1994 (cask #15), 56.6%",Single Malt Scotch,90,160,"an old-style whisky that harkens back to a time when scotland wasn’t sliced and diced by region, but defined by style. this is meaty with a capital m, with a rich, oily, deep character. on the palate it’s big and beautiful, with salt, oyster shell, honey, roasted green pepper, smoke, dried fruit, beef jerky, leather, and oak. earthy peat smoke dances throughout, giving support but never stealing focus. this is about as masculine as highland whisky gets. (u.s. only)"

(cask no. 69; 287 bottles)"
"craigellachie 13 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,90,53,"light amber. the initial impression is one of bulk. there are heavy florals — think lilies and stewed white fruit, and just-overripe banana — but this is given a mysterious extra heft by an underpinning of a light meatiness, accompanied by a tiny lift of (good) sulfur. the palate is, unsurprisingly, thick and creamy with huge fruit that fills the mouth. a highly physical, old-style speyside dram with classic distillery character. a statement whisky that is a must-try."

"adelphi (distilled at mortlach) 26 year old, 58.6%",Single Malt Scotch,90,295,"amber. very meaty, with a touch of cordite, then dark fruits, wet earth, and autumn woods, cut with spicy licorice and darjeeling tea. water brings down this exuberance, adding iris and whole grain bread. the palate has typical, full-on mortlach brawny muscle, with chestnut honey-glazed venison. water bringing out sweetness, but without ever losing that glowering core. lovers of the old 16 year old apply here."

"aberlour a’bunadh (batch 61), 60.8%",Single Malt Scotch,89,100,"a’bunadh is matured entirely in spanish oak oloroso butts, non-chill filtered, and bottled at cask strength. this edition is very rich, with dark berry notes on the nose, hazelnuts, caramel, cinnamon, and orange fondant creams. the palate is full and supple, with polished oak, honey, new leather, raisins, prunes, and a hint of cloves. very long in the finish, with plain chocolate, black pepper, fruity spices, and oak."
"ardbeg supernova, 58.9%",Single Malt Scotch,89,130,"identifiably richer, fuller, and smokier on the nose when compared to other young ardbegs. while still prominent, there’s slightly less brine and seaweed, more earthiness, tar, soot, espresso, tobacco, grass, and chocolate fudge. the same goes for the palate. it starts out like a “slightly more gutsy than normal” cask strength, young ardbeg (e.g., renaissance) and, if you go into this experience expecting to be totally blown away by peat, tar, and smoke, you might feel a bit under-challenged initially. but the peat eventually builds to a powerful, lava-like crescendo and you realize that this is no ordinary ardbeg. the length of the finish is seemingly endless; bold and warming. through all this, there’s a soft underbelly of ripe barley and a vanilla sweetness to balance at least some of the tar, heat, and smoke -- something i admire in many ardbegs.
bottom line: it’s an interesting, entertaining, and eye-opening experience. i like how mature it tastes for a relatively young whisky. but, like a whisky that shows just a bit too much sherry or oak, i think the extra peat, to a degree, masks the subtle complexities i admire in some other, lesser-peated ardbegs, which is the only thing keeping me from scoring this whisky in the 90s. all smoky whisky enthusiasts should endeavor to try this at least once."
"ardbeg rollercoaster, 57.3%",Single Malt Scotch,89,85,"deep gold color. very bold aroma of toffee, dark chocolate, diesel fuel-soaked soil, smoldering campfire, coal tar, clove, leather, fig, and dark berried fruit. more of the same on the palate, with seaweed, smoked haddock, and cough drops emerging towards the finish. this whisky is very dynamic and exciting to drink. my only criticism: it comes across a little green on the finish, which keeps me from scoring it in the 90s. still, it’s pretty impressive considering how young some of the whiskies in it are. if you like your islay whiskies young and brooding, this one’s for you."
"ardbeg day, 56.7%",Single Malt Scotch,89,90,"let it be known that from now on, june 2nd will be ardbeg day. that’s fine by me, as annually we can enjoy delights such as this bold expression that belts you in the nose with coal tar and soot before bay rum emerges, lightening slightly into lime and hot green bracken. the palate is oily, sweet, and very deep. a growly bugger that lurches toward the shore and then spins back to the laurel bushes inland. 13,000 bottles.	"
"ar4 elements of islay (distilled at ardbeg), 58.1%",Single Malt Scotch,89,151,"a touch of damp dunnage, some ardbeggian soot, and plenty of jalapeño-style heat. shows maturity and depth of character, with just-dead bonfire, ointment, and a sweetness, which here is like honeycomb. water makes it bolder, with deeper smoke, while the palate has sweet wood, balanced (cigar-accented) smoke, and layers of salt, angelica, and plum. £90/500 ml"
"ardbeg kildalton, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,191,"not an unpeated ardbeg, but a new initiative to raise money for the kildalton project which supports community projects in south islay. smoke, but also real sweetness: hothouse peaches, mezcal, smoked oyster, sphagnum moss, a huge hit of vetiver, and coal tar. the smoke flies to the throat before fogging forward, while the sweet core (with added raspberry and cream, and mint) moves to the back. a worthwhile dram and a hugely worthwhile cause. buy for either reason; or both. £120"
"ardbeg twenty one, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,500,"distilled at a time when the future of the distillery looked bleak. it is non-chill filtered and mildly herbal on the nose, with soft peat, muted iodine, and a sprinkling of pepper, plus warm leather. the palate is initially peppery, then vanilla and green apples emerge, along with aniseed and rich peat. peppery to the end, with a hint of iodine and coal smoke."
"double barrel ardbeg & craigellachie, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,89,78,"if i had to back one of the protagonists in douglas laing’s latest duel of the phial, my money would be squarely on the ardbeg. the nose delights with oils oozing from the chestnut flesh of a grilled kipper, coiled rope on a trawler’s deck, and hot pressed asphalt, with a gentle background note of roasted peanut and millionaire’s shortbread. medium texture: lemon and butterscotch, delicious fruitiness, and spearmint on the mid-palate. clean, creamy with a baked lemon finish. £49"

"arran 18 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,120,"this expression is the culmination of arran’s trilogy of 16, 17, and 18 year old releases, matured in sherry hogsheads. it is the oldest ‘house’ offering to date. floral and fragrant on the nose, with soft fruits and marzipan. balanced and rounded. viscous and full-bodied on the palate, with fruit spices, vanilla, sweet sherry, orange marmalade, and finally raisins. slowly drying to spicy plain chocolate and licorice.

"
"balblair 2000, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,89,55,"the 2000 vintage of balblair is intended to replace the well-regarded 1997 variant. matured in first-fill american oak, this very drinkable expression represents good value for the money. a pretty peach and pineapple nose, with coconut and honeyed vanilla. toasted marshmallows with time. relatively light-bodied, sweet, with lively spice, ginger, and youthful oak on the relatively complex palate. fudge in the finish, and a contrasting hint of dark chocolate at the last."

"benriach authenticus 21 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,170,"the follow-up and older sibling to ""curiositas."" i’ve been pushing for speyside distilleries to bump up the peating levels of their malt they use for a long time because a majority of the spirits are big enough to handle the peat smoke, and this whisky proves my point. the tarry, peat smoke and bacon-like notes are a delight, and they are balanced nicely by a honey and apple pie sweetness. spanish olives in brine, dark chocolate, golden raisin, and subtle spice round out the palate nicely. not a heavy whisky, but pretty powerful stuff for benriach. so nice of the previous owners of this distillery to experiment with higher peating levels decades ago. 
"
"benriach solstice 15 year old, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,89,87,"a heavily peated benriach that has been finished in a tawny port pipe. the nose is akin to cherries, sloes, and blueberries soaked in alcohol. the peatiness manifests itself as a smoky herbal note and shows most on the palate, but is never too dominant. an oil of clove coolness takes control on the finish. great balance and integration; a finish that genuinely works. £53 "
"benriach cask strength (batch 1), 57.2%",Single Malt Scotch,89,86,"remember those remarkable 20+ year old benriachs that appeared when the distillery reopened which we thought were gone forever? think again. this new and keenly priced arrival has sweet malt on the nose, followed by mango, orange blossom honey, and portuguese custard tarts. it needs a little water to calm the alcohol and help to spread an already thick texture along the tongue. a sweetly spicy and creamy hit toward the end. marked within its competitive set. £60"
"benriach 22 year old moscatel wood finish, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,180,"this limited edition bottling is non-chill filtered and initially matured in bourbon barrels before an unspecified period of finishing in sweet moscatel fortified wine casks from spain and portugal. sweet grapes, dates, cinnamon, salted butter, wax polish, and printer’s ink on the nose. viscous on the palate, with ripe plums, honey, plain chocolate, white pepper, and worn leather. the finish is long and fruity, with drying oak."

"
"bowmore fino cask, 1964 vintage, 49.4%",Single Malt Scotch,89,"1,500.00","amber-gold color. exotic tropical fruit aromas (citrus, melon, coconut), with interwoven notes of almonds, pear, honey, and subtle peat smoke. light to medium in body, and very delicate in nature. on the palate, the whisky begins sweet (especially honey), followed by a basket of exotic fruit and nuts similar to its aroma, becoming drier and distantly smoky on the finish. this bowmore fino cask, a whisky which has aged very well indeed, is the first of three limited edition 1964 vintage bowmore whiskies to be released over the next year. the two to follow in 2003 have been aged in bourbon oak and oloros sherry casks."
"bowmore voyage, 56%",Single Malt Scotch,89,120,"copper color with shades of ruby. intriguing aromas of sweet plum, grapes, citrus, peat smoke, seaweed, and brine. full-bodied and somewhat viscous. flavors of ripe fruit (plums, grapes, citrus), followed by a burst of more traditional bowmore flavors (peat smoke, brine, seaweed), finishing with lingering notes of prunes, dates, baker’s chocolate, and licorice.

while there is no age statement, this whisky was aged for 12 years in bourbon barrels, followed by an additional 18 months in ruby port casks. i believe it is the first distillery bottling to marry port with the traditional flavors of an islay whisky. because of this, it is best to keep an open mind when trying this whisky, perhaps even having more than one go at it before rendering a verdict. i suspect the more you try voyage, the more you will like."
bowmore claret (56%),Single Malt Scotch,89,90,"amber with orange and ruby hues. aromas of islay peat smoke, wine fruit, and background floral and spice notes. flavors reveal more of what the aroma suggests-peat smoke, fruit, and floral/spice notes-with a balancing oak and subtle sea salt and seaweed. the peat smoke particularly comes in on the finish, lest one forgets where bowmore hails from. 
   style: islay single malt scotch whisky. price: approx. $90. availability: only 480 bottles for the entire united states, with the remainder of the 12,000 bottles going to duty free. 
   there is no age statement on the label, but this whisky has been aged for 12 years in traditional bourbon and sherry barrels, and then finished off for 18 months in bordeaux (claret) wine casks. the wine fruit certainly is evident and, like the glenmorangie claret wood finish offered a year or so ago, will appeal to those with an open mind and willingness to accept new flavors in whisky. purists will say it detracts from the distillery's character. i believe it's the first smoky whisky that attempts to marry these flavors with claret fruitiness."
"blackadder (distilled at bowmore), 27 years old, 50.5%",Single Malt Scotch,89,160,"amber color. aromas of peat smoke (but more subdued than many bowmore whiskies in their teens), toasted oak, citrus fruit, vanilla, and a hint of the sea. its flavors are similar, which express themselves in a very mature manner-oak flavors are more dominant than other components. still, there is an emerging brine freshness that keeps the whisky from becoming tired and dull. good, lengthy finish. 
style: islay single malt scotch whisky. price: approx. $160. availability: only 244 bottles total."
cadenhead,Single Malt Scotch,89,125,"antique gold color. aromas of peat smoke, damp earth, exotic pepper, vanilla, and fruit. medium body. a great balance of flavors, with a lovely islay character. the whisky begins sweet up front, ultimately turning pleasingly dry towards the finish. in between you'll enjoy flavors of peat smoke, vanilla, spicy pepper, and delicately honeyed malt, with just a hint of the sea. what i like most about this whisky is its impeccable balance-between youth and maturity, sweetness and dryness-with just the right amount of peat smoke to declare its islay roots without smothering its other flavors."
"wemyss malts the rockpool (distilled at bowmore) 1995, 57.2%",Single Malt Scotch,89,180,"a very solid and sound bowmore with saline notes, some dried hot pepper, and masses of menthol, which give a buzzy, nose-cleaning effect. the smoke gently glides along throughout. the palate is quite thick and shows sweetness and a slow release of soft fruit, with a tingle of salt. the smoke slowly increases until it concentrates on the back palate, giving an effect like burning pine logs on the beach. becomes nicely funky in time. recommended. £115"
"scott's selection (distilled at bruichladdich), 14 year old, 1990 vintage, 58.1%",Single Malt Scotch,89,110,"an excellent example of a younger bruichladdich, and an interesting contrast to the duncan taylor expression reviewed above. appetizing and very clean with a creamy texture. honey and vanilla notes accentuate a fresh maltiness, with underlying marshmallow, grass and hay. the whisky finishes nicely rounded, pleasingly dry and salty, with a hint of seaweed. a great aperitif. 
"
"bruichladdich black art 4 23 year old, 49.2%",Single Malt Scotch,89,322,"a mélange of casks and techniques that only jim mcewan knows about. the fourth iteration of his black art manages to mix mature notes of beeswax-burnished church pews, a sprinkling of rose water, dried mango, rosehip syrup, and potpourri. the palate opens to parma violets, underpinned with light lavender, where fleshiness mingles with the exotic notes of manuka honey, pomegranate, apricot pits, and dried lemon. it pushes malt into a new area, but that’s the point. £200"
"bruichladdich bere barley 2008, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,89,83,"bere is an ancient strain of barley which is stubbornly difficult to grow and mash. for this, bruichladdich has gone to a specialist farm on orkney. the nose is intriguingly aromatic, sweet and slightly corn-like, with a sweet nuttiness behind. it becomes very floral (night-scented stocks) with white currant, lemon sherbet, and a lift of tangerine before water brings out sakura (cherry blossom) syrup and bread. the palate is very sweet and concentrated. remarkable. keep watching. £52"
"bruichladdich the laddie ten second limited edition, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,89,66,"matured in first-fill sherry, bourbon, and french wine casks. clean and fresh on the early nose; crisp green apples, vanilla, and floral notes, with just a hint of maritime influence in the background. smooth on the palate, with spicy pear, honey, and ripe peaches; soon quite drying. the floral finish lingers, with spicy honey, drying spices, and ultimately a hint of smoke. (18,000 bottles)"
"duncan taylor (distilled at bunnahabhain), cask #7020, 39 year old, 40.5%",Single Malt Scotch,89,420,"there have been several lovely older expressions of bunnahabhain over the past decade, and this is one of them. the vanilla cream and toffee nuttiness is balanced perfectly by polished oak, bright fruit (apricot, sultana, cherry pits), and subtle anise. there’s a calming quality to this whisky that is very more-ish. all the maturity of an older whisky without the tired, dominating oak.
"
"bunnahabhain, 12 year old, 46.3%,",Single Malt Scotch,89,53,"the new version, at a higher proof and not chill-filtered. that helped — especially on the palate — with greater texture and more well-defined flavors. but the flavors are essentially the same: nutty, toffee, light molasses, vanilla fudge, with delicate fruit (citrus, dark berries) and a hint of brine. very comforting. extra points for versatility — this whisky will accommodate many moods and situations. "
"mackillop's choice (distilled at caol ila), 15 year old, 1990 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,89,75,"fresh and quite aromatic. nice interplay between soothing malty sweetness and honest “naked” caol ila notes (in the sense that all the classic caol ila flavors are exposed-leafy smoke, tarry rope, salt & pepper spice, seaweed, and olive). an evolving whisky, with a phenolic, briny crescendo that lingers. nicely done. 
"
"signatory (distilled at caol ila) 1989, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,89,45,"pale gold color. aromas and flavors of peat smoke, seaweed, lemon grass, olives, and green peppercorns. medium bodied, and slightly oily in texture. long, dry peat smoke finish. caol ila is an islay dram that laphroaig, lagavulin, and bowmore fans must become acquainted with. although distllery bottlings are not available here in the u.s., many independent bottlers offer it. this expression is young, vibrant, and exciting."
"gordon & macphail (distilled at caol ila), 14 year old, 1991 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,75,"finished in cognac wood. the cognac wood influence might dominate other whiskies, but the coal ila is big enough for challenge. if anything, it seems to contribute a silky elegance to what would otherwise be a brooding, bare-knuckled whisky;. it works nicely. notes of germinating barley, vanilla cream, grape preserve, and peat bonfire, with a salty, smoky finish. (available in the chicago area.) 
"
"douglas of drumlanrig (distilled at caol ila), cask #6616, 1985 vintage, 25 year old, 53.9%",Single Malt Scotch,89,150,"soft and gentle (for caol ila, that is), thanks to the 25 years of aging. plenty of creamy vanilla and honey to go with the malty foundation, along with coal tar, licorice root, and olive, with a hint of brine, juniper, unsweetened dark chocolate, and tobacco (cigars in a humidor?). very nice. (a julio’s liquors exclusive.)"
"caol ila 12 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,89,50,"funny to think how recently caol ila was an islay giant that was kept pretty much under wraps by its owner. these days it has cemented its reputation as the island’s mr. consistent. this version shows its character the best, a nose that mixes seashore and grass with a distinct hint of smoked bacon. the peatiness isn’t dominant, but flows throughout the palate, scenting, lifting, and subtly changing the mix. a delicious oiliness makes it a great food whisky."
"caol ila stitchell reserve, 59.6%",Single Malt Scotch,89,110,"caol ila in unpeated guise. there’s no age statement, but what you get is a mix of the fresh and the mature: a vibrant attack with fresh victoria plum, grapes, and a hint of oiliness. give it time and the sensation is like afternoon tea at your auntie’s, with thickly-buttered scones dripping with honey or pineapple jam. the palate is equally sweet and gentle, and only needs a little drop of water to reveal light spice. a wee beauty."
"caol ila unpeated 1997 17 year old (diageo special release 2015), 55.9%",Single Malt Scotch,89,140,"aged in first-fill american oak, this shows a real brightness, crisp fruit, and some smoke—it’s not really unpeated—and wet grass, before moving into pear and tarragon. the palate is intense, with a hay note, then an almost fino sherry-like note before sashimi emerges. reduced, there’s more of a soft flow, though there’s still a touch of green olive minerality. a steal at this price. snap it up."
"cragganmore distillers edition 1997, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,89,67,"cragganmore is a deep malt but its richness is often obscured by its fruity sweetness. a period in port pipes allows this element to be amplified. the black currant is now fully fruited and acts as a flavor bridge while the meatiness that sits underneath and often unseen is revealed. think cherry pipe tobacco, clove, and dark fruits. sweet, but not too sweet, and always identifiably cragganmore. for me, the pick of the bunch."
"cragganmore, 55.7%",Single Malt Scotch,89,600,"an inviting and complex nose of honey, orchard fruits, apple blossom, rosewater, and subtle cinnamon. rich and creamy in the mouth, with initially intensely sweet fruit and spice notes, followed by ginger, toffee, and vanilla. the finish is warming, gently spicy, and medium in length. diageo special releases 2016 bottling. (4,932 bottles)"
"cadenhead's, (distilled at dalmore), 1987, 59.9%",Single Malt Scotch,89,115,"gold color. aromas of citrus fruit (lemons, tangerines) and a pot pourri of spices-very fragrant. appetizing flavors of citrus fruit, exotic spices, along with a slightly briny, peppery finish. 
"
"the dalmore 1973 aged 38 years, 48.1%",Single Malt Scotch,89,17600,"primary maturation took place in an ex-bourbon cask, then from 2006 in a cask sourced from the vineyard of chateau haut marbuzet, previously used to hold cabernet sauvignon. a final three years were spent in a newly-emptied bourbon barrel. gingerbread, summer berries, and fig rolls on the nose. fudge and vanilla. black cherries, raisins, lots of lively spice, and a red wine ‘edge’ in the mouth. freshly-baked ginger cake in the long, spicy finish. cask number 10; 223 bottles. "
"the dalmore 1991 aged 20 years, 57.9%",Single Malt Scotch,89,3600,"after initial maturation in american white oak, this 1991 expression was filled into a 15 year old lepanto brandy cask from gonzales byass in may 2003, ultimately being re-racked into a fresh ‘distillery run’ bourbon barrel in august 2009. caramel and white chocolate on the nose, malt, fudge, cinnamon, and nutmeg, then burnt treacle and hot brandy. malt, sweet spice, almonds, bananas, and fudge on the palate. spicy fruits in the lengthy armagnac-like finish. cask number 1; 233 bottles. "
"glen elgin 18 year old (diageo special releases 2017), 54.8%",Single Malt Scotch,89,340,"matured in european oak butts, this 1998 single malt has a nose of soft toffee, vanilla, and orchard fruits. the palate is very full and sweet, even sugary, with baked apples, peaches in cream, and cinnamon. medium to long in the finish, with fruity oak, lingering ginger, and pepper. (5,352 bottles)"
"peerless (distilled at glen grant) 1970, 46.1%",Single Malt Scotch,89,160,"mahogany color. full-bodied, thick and chewy. incredibly rich aroma and flavors of toffee, fudge, spice cake, ripe fruit, burnished leather, and oak. nicely balanced throughout, with a long, satisfying finish. 
"
"glen scotia 21 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,145,"the nose offers tinned peaches, fresh ginger, and a slightly herbal note. the palate is voluptuous, with vanilla, malt, vigorous spices, and white chocolate. lingering coffee and gingery oak in the finish. "
"duncan taylor 'rarest of the rare' glencraig (distilled at glenburgie), cask #2926, 30 year old, 1974 vintage, 42.0%",Single Malt Scotch,89,245,"soothing vanilla cream, with additional notes of spice cake, coconut marshmallow, tiramisu, fresh cut grass, and a hint of evergreen. a true ""comfort"" whisky. just don’t add any water, because it will fall flat. this whisky is great just the way it is. 
"
"glendronach peated port wood, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,97,"this is non-chill filtered and carries no age statement. the nose is earthy, with damp herbaceous borders, quite acrid smoke, and spicy cranberries. fresh, juicy red berries on the palate, with background peat smoke becoming ashy, with rich red wine notes. the red wine persists in the finish, accompanied by prickly black pepper. £70; not available in the u.s."
"glenfarclas 50 year old, 1955 vintage, 44.4%",Single Malt Scotch,89,6000,"the oldest whisky ever bottled by glenfarclas. fortunately, glenfarclas ages very nicely. this whisky proves my point. it is very complex, with notes of burnished leather, roasted nuts, fruit cake, toffee apples, sultana, damp peat, and sappy oak. a very soothing whisky, with the depth and maturity one hopes for in a whisky this old. only 110 bottles produced and only 18 destined for the u.s. 
"
"glenfarclas family cask 1982 (cask 4567), 56%",Single Malt Scotch,89,329,"amber in color and again some fresh fruitiness, this time mixed with a little cereal. the same dry grass you get on the 1981, but here there’s a nutty, biscuity edge above that meaty solidity. the palate shows slight oiliness and roasted red pepper, that changes into blackberry as it opens. needs roughly the same amount of water to open fully, which also brings out chamois leather and then barley sugar sweets. clean but rich — that’s glenfarclas. (a u.s. exclusive.)"
"glenfarclas family casks 1974 cask #8579, 57.2%",Single Malt Scotch,89,1052,"although from a refill, the mahogany color suggests a short previous use. some nose burn, with a mature edge of leather and dark chocolate. here’s glenfarclas in a darker guise, with raisin and a savory aspect; think roast pheasant and walnuts, lamb and mint sauce. the palate is big, thick, and sweet with lots of extract, but also turkish delight, sultana, and prune. while sherried, it’s not in any way overcooked; the tannins are balanced, the sweetness massive. £625"
glenfarclas £511. 19s. 0d.,Single Malt Scotch,89,130,"unusually named—it refers to the price paid for the distillery—here is glenfarclas in slightly lighter guise than usual. fresh and clean at the start, with hints of sweet nut and soft cooked fruits; subtly sherried elements then begin to come through. the palate is balanced, with supple tannins and a dark depth to the mid-palate. those sweet fruits in the nose continue all the way through. refined and rather lovely. £85"
"glenfiddich, 21 year old, gran reserva caribbean rum finish, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,89,120,"soothing and seamless on the nose and palate with chewy toffee, molasses, nougat, almond butter, vanilla fudge, cinnamon spice, and nutmeg, along with gentle tobacco notes emerging later on the palate. a pleasing dry finish offsets the sweeter notes. a delicious whisky from beginning to end. 
"
"glenfiddich cask of dreams, 48.8%",Single Malt Scotch,89,99,"a vatting of different ages of glenfiddich (the youngest being 14 years old) aged in american oak, then married in virgin american oak casks on which folk from the states had written their hopes and dreams…awww! deliciously fruity and clean, it’s all pear juice, crème brûlée, fudge, cool mint, and dessert apple. with water, there’s dusty cinnamon, kiwi, and milk chocolate. the oak acts as a smoothing base for this fruitiness. a lovely idea and a lovely whisky. "
"glengarioch, 21 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,89,110,"amber gold color. surprisingly smoky aroma balanced nicely with mature oak notes, roasted nuts, tobacco, and malty sweetness in the background. firm body. delicious flavors of toasted oak, roasted nuts, smoke, leather, and malt. the flavors are interwoven nicely with great balance. satisfying finish. 
"
"glen garioch 1991, 54.7%",Single Malt Scotch,89,100,"distilled at glen garioch when peated barley was still being used, this 1991 vintage is quite reticent on the nose, considering its strength. subtle malt and fudge notes, plus a hint of wood smoke. fresh fruits and a sherbet ‘zing’ on the palate, with a suggestion of treacle. developing spicy smokiness. fruitiness is emphasized when water is added. the ‘zing’ — now ginger — lasts to the end of the medium-length finish, with advancing, discreet oak. (only 120 bottles for the u.s.) "
"glen garioch cask no. 986 13 year old, 55%",Single Malt Scotch,89,100,"a lovely example of what not chill-filtering can do for a whisky. meticulous cask selection also helps play a part here. very straightforward on the surface (no surprises), but with vibrant, well-defined flavors and a comforting creamy texture on the palate. bright fruit defines this whisky (lime, kiwi, ripe melon, sultana, fresh peach), accompanied by honeyed malt, heather, and a hint of spice and smoke. a fun whisky, suitable for many moods and occasions. (a park avenue liquor exclusive.) "
"glen garioch vintage 1999, 56.3%",Single Malt Scotch,89,98,"this limited edition release of glen garioch is the first from the aberdeenshire distillery to have been matured entirely in oloroso sherry casks. just 1,000 cases of the 14 year old expression are available globally. old leather, slightly earthy, sultanas, white pepper, and a hint of lemon pith on the nose. the palate is big and bold, with more pepper, plus cinnamon caramel, orange, and abundant sherry. enduring spice, licorice, and slightly smoky raisins in the finish."
"glenglassaugh massandra connection 41 year old sherry wood finish, 44.5%",Single Malt Scotch,89,1087,"the massandra winery, which supplies casks for glenglassaugh’s massandra connection bottlings, is the oldest in crimea, and reputedly produced tsar alexander iii’s favorite wines. the 1973 distillation, which has been finished in sherry casks, has a nose of sultanas, cinnamon, sweet grass, and herbal notes in the background. bung cloth, char, and finally damp undergrowth. complex aromatic progression. mouth-coating, with sweet, spicy tropical fruit notes and oloroso. slowly drying, with bitter orange and mild tannins at the close. £645"
"glengoyne 26 year old single cask #384 distilled 1987, 54.6%",Single Malt Scotch,89,557,"this 26 year old single cask glengoyne was matured in a first-fill european oak sherry butt that yielded 339 bottles. it offers a nose of sultanas, figs, and vanilla, plus white pepper and a hint of linseed. succulent in the mouth, the palate yields sweet sherry, honey, and contrasting lemon juice and pepper. the finish is lengthy, but dries rapidly, with lively pepper, oak tannins, and a final fatty note. £350"
"glenkinchie 20 year old, 55.1%",Single Malt Scotch,89,189,"if cragganmore is sometimes overlooked, then what of this poor lowlander whose qualities are consistently overlooked? again, here we have a pale color suggesting use of refill casks, but whereas cragganmore was reticent to the point of being mute, this is expressive and lively. 
the nose, with intense floral notes of lilac blossom, freesia, and chamomile, is a revelation. these are backed with a thick, unsalted butter note that suggests that the cask might not have been as quiet as first imagined. give it time, and out come boiled sweets and a fresh green note, like a just-whittled stick. a hint of wheat chaff and fragrant grasses brings to mind lying in a summer meadow watching the dust motes dance in the sunshine. 
the mouth is sweet and lemon-accented with a pickup of a pleasant chalkiness on the nose that gives it the suggestion of a fino sherry or vin jaune. i like its energy, and feel that the addition of water reduces its vibrancy, so for drinking purposes i’d have a glass of ice cold water on the side. all in all impressive, with just a hint of soap on the finish taking it below the 90 mark. "
"the glenlivet cellar collection, 1983 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,200,"style: speyside single malt scotch color: amber aroma: rich and rather full for glenlivet, with nuts and fruit, drenched with layers of toffee and caramel. palate: rich and enveloping-almost chewy-with notes of toffee and caramel up front. delicate fruit, nuts and spice emerge mid-palate, adding complexity, becoming dry with a long spicy finish 
"
"scott's selection (distilled at glenlivet), 27 year old, 1977 vintage, 53.1%",Single Malt Scotch,89,165,"very stylish. quite refined too, with notes of vanilla, peaches and flowering currant. the whisky is very soft on the palate, delicate and almost bashful at times. indeed, it may take a couple of dates with this whisky for it to fully to reveal itself. the whisky finishes toasty, with a pleasing cereal grain maltiness. some whiskies are great after dinner; others make wonderful pre-dinner drams. this one is great anytime. 
"
"glenlivet archive, 21 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,89,130,"new packaging and new whisky too-sort of. according to glenlivet’s whisky maker jim cryle, archive is now being bottled in smaller batches, allowing them to be more selective in the casks used to improve its quality and flavor. i believe that it has worked. it tastes more refined. along with archive’s signature creamy toffee notes, i’m picking up beautiful floral, vanilla, and fruity notes (peaches, pineapple, coconut) on the nose and palate, with subtler nutty, anise threads throughout. an elegant expression of glenlivet. 
"
"the glenlivet cellar collection, 1972 vintage, 52.3%",Single Malt Scotch,89,700,"lovely bouquet of dried citrus fruit, honeyed apricot and plum, complemented by exotic wood spice, malty vanilla, and a hint of mint and anise. similar follow-through on the palate, with the sweeter notes up front, full fruit impact mid-palate, leading to a dry, peppery, exotic wood spice finish. the whisky evolves on the palate and is very impressive, with its only blemish being a bit too dry and oaky on the finish. 
"
"duncan taylor (distilled at glenlivet), cask #2831, 39 year old, 44.7%",Single Malt Scotch,89,305,"this whisky fits the profile of other extra-matured glenlivet whiskies i’ve tasted. notes of coconut and other assorted tropical fruit, old rum, caramel custard, shortbread cookies, vanilla malt, and a hint of cotton candy. this is all balanced by polished oak. a soothing, rather sweet whisky (which is quite surprising for its age)."
"glenmorangie tain l'hermitage wood finish, 1975 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,200,"for those of you drinking whisky long enough, it was a glenmorangie tain l’hermitage 1978 vintage that kick-started this whole exotic finish trend by glenmorangie about 10 years ago. that one wasn’t sold here in the u.s., but this one is (although this one costs about four times as much as the original one did when it was released). both were racked in used bourbon barrels before being finished in hermitage red wine casks from northern rhone. the best of these limited release glenmorangies, like the fino sherry finish expression several years ago, add complexity and intrigue without masking glenmorangie’s lovely subtle complexity. this one does a pretty good job of it, although there’s a lot of fruit here (an obvious contribution of the wine). complex fruit, with notes of plum, raspberry, nectarine, blueberries, and a hint of lemon. underneath the fruit, there’s nougat, dark chocolate and cocoa. towards the finish, the whisky becomes nicely dry with oak lingering on the palate. 
"
"glenmorangie, 18 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,89,135,"when compared to the 10 year old, this one’s richer, with darker fruit and more caramelized sweet notes, paired with accentuated dried wood spice, while the 10 year old is more vibrant and floral. like the 10 year old, there’s good balance here.
"
"glenmorangie nectar d'or, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,75,"finished (extra-matured, as they are now saying) in sauternes casks. this expression replaces the madeira wood finish. beautiful sweet notes of honeycomb, sultana, apple pie, and white chocolate balanced by peach, coconut, and pineapple. gentle background spice. the sauternes cask adds extra weight and viscosity. the sweetness is not cloying, nor does it dominate the flavor profile. a good demonstration of the benefits of wood finishing. 
"
"glenmorangie milsean, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,99,"milsean is the latest private edition release from glenmorangie. after initial bourbon barrel maturation, the whisky spent several years in heavily-toasted portuguese red wine casks. fresh fruits on the early nose, with ginger and a hint of musk. coconut and icing sugar emerge. smooth and rounded on the palate with a big fruit hit that becomes more citric in time, plus lively oak spices. lingering in the finish, with persistent spice. finally, plain chocolate and chili."
"glenmorangie spìos, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,99,"the ninth release in glenmorangie’s private edition series was matured fully in american oak barrels that previously contained rye whiskey. a reticent early nose: melon and a hint of lemon, then warm, oily cereal notes and honey develop. initially fruity on the palate, with ripe banana, then slightly earthy, with nutty spice and cocoa powder. zesty spices in the finish, drinking chocolate, and youthful oak."
"gordon & macphail reserve (distilled at glenrothes), 18 year old, 1986 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,80,"it's nice to see gordon & macphail bottlings at strengths higher than 40%, and it makes this already hefty whisky even more so. it is fragrant (with subtle heather notes), rich and malty (and quite thick in texture), with notes of honey and vanilla. interwoven fruit (sultana, along with subtle lemon and orange) add complexity. all this sweetness is rounded out nicely with a long, dry, oaky/spicy finish. a delicious, evolving whisky. (bottled exclusively for binny's beverage depot.)"
"the glenrothes, 1985 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,89,120,"interestingly, this whisky was bottled in 2005, but not released until the end of 2008. (the brand manager tells me that they wanted to wait until the stocks of the current 1980s vintage (a 1987) were depleted. it’s fresh, lively, and uncluttered, glowing with bright fruit (mandarin orange, nectarine), lemon meringue pie, and a creamy vanilla sweetness that coats the palate. a gently dry oak finish with subtle anise and very dark chocolate. a perky glenrothes, and a lot of fun to drink. 
"
"glenrothes vintage reserve, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,89,55,"glenrothes is always this fascinating mix of the malty and the fruity and is one of those drams which needs time in the glass to open. given that time, you will be rewarded with date, raisin, some fudge, and some real savory depth before a sprinkling of trail mix and a sweetening into nougat and caramel, spice and chocolate. a replacement for the old select reserve, this is a magnificent glenrothes and at a great price, so don’t dare moan."
"glenrothes 1995 american oak, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,89,123,"the initial glenrothes 1995 was released in 2011. this edition comprises first-fill american oak casks seasoned with dry oloroso sherry. significant sherry cask influence early on the nose, with a savory note, rich fruitcake, cherries, malt, and developing vanilla custard. supple in the mouth, with honey, berry fruits, and citrus notes. spicier in time. the finish dries slightly, with cinnamon and a sprinkling of black pepper."

"
"murray mcdavid mission iv (distilled at highland park), 1979 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,210,"clean and fragrant on the nose, with aromas of dried heather, germinating barley, and white chocolate. soft, sweet malt along with honeycomb, crème brulee, and a hint of fruit puree. the palate is soothingly malty, delivering what the aroma promised (first the sweet notes, then dried heather and spice), with a dry, polished oak finish. the extra aging adds depth, and the cask was obviously a good one, with no hint of being tired or old. 
"
murray mcdavid ,Single Malt Scotch,89,150,"yellow gold color. fresh, floral aromas (reminiscent of a spring garden), creamy vanilla, honey, heather, subtle fruit, and a hint of toasted oak. elegant and nicely balanced. medium in body, but richly so. richly flavored, too, and nicely balanced, with notes that echo the aromas. in fact, this is one of the most balanced whiskies i've had in quite a while. a hint of salt, spice, and seaweed on the finish linger on indefinitely. this whisky is a pure joy to drink and demonstrates why highland park is so highly regarded. the fact that it was aged in a bourbon cask allows this whisky's more subtle notes to be fully appreciated. quite delicious!"
"highland park 1976 vintage, 49.1%",Single Malt Scotch,89,2880,"this is a recent addition to the portfolio, and has been matured in a mixture of thirteen american oak butts and hogsheads. these have given an out-turn of 893 bottles. freshly-grated ginger, white pepper, and melons on the nose. soft fruit and spices feature on the palate, with honey and coconut oil, plus background peat smoke. lively spices, soft oak, and hazelnuts in the finish."
"a.d. rattray (distilled at highland park) 19 year old 1992, 48.8%",Single Malt Scotch,89,120,"many of the independent  h.p. bottlings are aged in bourbon casks, and, like this one, exhibit creamy vanilla, honeyed malt, and citrus. i’m also picking up some more subtle heather, brine, coconut, and nougat. this one is clean on the palate and shows nice balance, with enough dry oak on the finish to counter the whisky’s sweeter notes.

"jura camas an staca 30 year old, 44%",Single Malt Scotch,89,560,"the latest addition to the jura range has been matured in american white oak casks before spending three years in gonzalez byass oloroso sherry butts. the mellow nose is lightly oily, with figs, sherry, orange, and a savory note. vanilla emerges, along with malt, and finally a hint of cinnamon and parma violets. soft and supple on the palate, with more orange, plus cocoa, sultanas, and dates. the finish is lengthy and features dark chocolate, raisins, aniseed, and subtle spices. "
"lagavulin, 21 year, 56.5%",Single Malt Scotch,89,300,"a thick, sweet, weighty lagavulin -- the kind you eat with a fork. interwoven caramel and molasses laced with thumping waxed fruit, dates, burnt walnuts, and peat kiln embers that linger long on the palate. a mouthful!"

"
"the exclusive malts (distilled at laphroaig) 8 year old 2005 cask no. 484, 55.9%",Single Malt Scotch,89,85,"this whisky shows no signs of immaturity considering its age. indeed, enjoying laphroaig young and at a higher strength is the best way to appreciate the distillery’s true character. very medicinal and “closed up” neat, but comes alive with a splash of water. powerful notes of tar, charcoal, smoked seaweed, and licorice root, mercifully tamed by ripe barley and honeyed malt laced with vanilla. warm, smoky, charred oak finish. (u.s. only)"
"lp4 elements of islay (distilled at laphroaig), 54.8%",Single Malt Scotch,89,108,"a very tarry start, like fence posts which have just been treated with creosote. add in some smoked fish alongside dried grass, and you have all the requisite elements for a classic laphroaig. the palate is massively smoky to start, a real peat bomb, but that eruption recedes, allowing barley and sweetness to come through. this is a serious dram which needs water to coat the tongue. very good. £65/500 ml"
"lp5 elements of islay (distilled at laphroaig), 52.4%",Single Malt Scotch,89,118,"bold, with smoked fish (arbroath smokies), dried fruits. has requisite density of character with classic notes of freshly-laid tarmac and medicine. a lemon edge adds some lift. the complexity continues on the tongue, which is very juicy; vanilla-accented but with plenty of seaweed-like smoke that shifts into licorice. long, balanced, and thick in the center, with some (smoked) dried thyme on the finish. £70/500 ml"

"ledaig 19 year old, 51%",Single Malt Scotch,89,155,"some of the first peated spirit produced in the late 1990s at tobermory distillery has gone into this bottling, which has been finished in marsala wine casks. the nose yields earthy malt, new leather, printer’s ink, and a final fragrant note. big, bright flavors of orchard fruits and sweet peat on the palate, plus black pepper and dessert wine. ashy peat, burnt oak, and lingering pepperiness in the finish."
"exclusive malts (distilled at linkwood) 14 year old 1999 cask # 978, 55.8%",Single Malt Scotch,89,105,"from a speyside distillery whose malt is more commonly found in blends. an enticing and complex nose balances sweet honey, acidic dried orange, rich walnut, and light smoke. on the palate these elements come together well with complexity and balance. things get spicy in the mid-palate, with black pepper, salt, ginger, and a bump in smoke. a long finish rounds everything off, showcasing smoke and orange. lots of character and flavor for an uncommon malt. (u.s. only)"
"longmorn 16 year old, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,89,90,"longmorn is now being bottled one year older. whisky companies seem to be discontinuing odd-year whiskies. bowmore recently extended their 17 year old to 18. ironically, in both instances, the older whiskies serve up more sherry and fruit. both the longmorn 15 and bowmore 17 were considered benchmark whiskies, so these changes weren’t without risk. still, in both instances, the new expressions won’t disappoint. this new longmorn shows a mouth-coating maltiness -- longmorn’s signature characteristic. along with this, there’s ripe barley, honeyed fruit (peach, with subtle sultana and pineapple), gently complex nuts (almonds, brazil nuts), and a hint of chocolate-covered coconut. a lush, fruity-sweet dram that lingers long on the palate. true longmorn devotees will still want to purchase a bottle of the 15 year old while they can."
"longmorn 16 year old, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,89,110,"longmorn may be slightly better known, but it’s still pretty much a cult whisky — with a huge following in japan, where every whisky bar seems to have multiple expressions. this bottling shows it in its lushest guise, with masses of caramelized soft fruits, banana, cream toffee, and chocolate. the palate shifts between raisin and plum. elegant. "
"duncan taylor dimensions range (distilled at longmorn) 1996, 52.6%",Single Malt Scotch,89,154,"immediately identifiably longmorn: that ridiculous, highly amenable mix of soft fruits, masses of sweet spice, candied peels, coconut, and sticky toffee pudding. in fact, it’s almost over the top in its lushness. leans into the mouth with masses of mace, then soft fruits and marzipan develop. unctuous, long, and ripe, the wood shows just a little, but the depth and richness holds it in check. very good. £97"
"scott selection (distilled at macallan) 1973, 50.9%",Single Malt Scotch,89,230,"deep gold color. fragrant, floral aroma, with a potpourri of dried spices, especially vanilla and nutmeg. creamy texture. flavors of creamy vanilla and caramel, becoming dry with subtle spices and just a hint of fruit. 
"
"the macallan fine oak, 21 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,89,220,"even drier and expressing more of the complex floral and spice notes found in the 15 year old. however, by the time the whisky reaches mid-palate, the dried fruits, dried spices, and general wood notes become prominent, preventing the whisky from revealing other sides of its usually multi-faceted personality. it’s still a very fine whisky, but not as good as the 15, regardless of price. 
"
"adelphi (distilled at macallan) 22 year old, 56%",Single Malt Scotch,89,151,"initially, this is macallan in effusive willy wonka mood, with lots of toffee, chocolate, greengage, and light oiliness. the aroma thickens with water, and with it a more serious mien: brogues buffed to a high sheen. the palate is equally rich and layered, with cereal, black cherry, discreet oak. a complex mix, as befits a gentleman’s dram that every gentleman should have. £95"
"mackillop's choice (distilled at mortlach), 22 year old, 1982 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,89,100,"toffee and nougat, with a lacing of cotton candy. it then turns richly nutty-almost chewy-with notes of dried apricot, sultana, and a touch of red currant. firm, dry, oak resin finish. a well-structured whisky, indicative of the mortlach pedigree. 
"
"berry brothers & rudd (distilled at mortlach) 1989 21 year old, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,89,94,"immediately identifiable as mortlach, with a pleasant, feral mélange of meat mingled with milk chocolate and gorse. there is elegant sweetness here, but expressed as a mix of the bittersweet caramelized juices stuck to the bottom of a roasting pan, with honey. the palate, unsurprisingly, is big, and medium dry, but here as well there’s some sweetness in the form of black fruits. mortlach, but in a slightly subtler guise than usual. £60"
"gordon & macphail private collection (distilled at old pulteney), cask #06/125, 1994 vintage, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,89,100,"finished in sauternes wood. i really love how the appetizing notes of pulteney marry with the sweet notes of the sauternes wine cask. light-medium in body, but good viscosity. fresh brine throughout, with honey-drenched melon fruit, pineapple in syrup, citrus, and a hint of cotton candy and lightly toasted marshmallow. a delicious marriage of two high-caliber drinks categories.

"provenance (distilled at port ellen), 21 year old, 1982 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,195,"one of the last remaining vintages from an islay distillery which will be missed dearly. this is obviously from a sherry cask, and the peat smoke, sherry, and oak-aging is married nicely here. it a brooding port ellen. notes of peat fires, fig, kippers, toffee, vanilla, and dry oak take turns entertaining the palate. considering its age, it isn’t excessively oaked, and the port ellen character still shines through. if you’re going to track down a bottle of port ellen before they get really difficult to find, this one is worth serious consideration. 
"
"port ellen, 29 year old, 55.3%",Single Malt Scotch,89,400,"an elder port ellen, but still showing plenty of port ellen character. it’s chock full of kiln smoke, damp forest, seaweed, charcoal, brine, and tar. additional notes of licorice root, kalamata olive, cinnamon, and black pepper, with teasing citrus emerging occasionally. warming, tarry, dry smoke finish. an old-fashioned, pungent islay whisky.
"
"the whisky exchange elements of islay pe5 (distilled at port ellen), 57.9%",Single Malt Scotch,89,279,"this, the fifth of twe’s ongoing elements bottlings of islay’s legendary closed distillery, does not disappoint. the nose is akin to salted chocolate, with a wasabi-like earthiness lurking behind. port ellen’s characteristic flintiness is there in the form of rock-pools and hot sand inside seashells, while the smoke hints at sphagnum moss, marsh gas, and burnt cake. the palate has touches of smoked eel and a hint of pear. as enigmatic as ever, in other words. £175 (500 ml)"
"port ellen 1983 32 year old (diageo special release 2015), 53.9%",Single Malt Scotch,89,3700,"matured in refill european oak sherry butts, this year’s special release has more weight than many previous expressions and a fascinating smokiness that comes across like a just-lit fire: fire lighter, burning paper, fire grate, and wood smoke. the more active oak adds walnut skin notes and rich dried fruits before the smoke returns. all very sophisticated with enough sweetness to balance. excellent, but, ouch, that price!"
"rosebank 21 year old 1990 (diageo special releases 2011), 53.8%",Single Malt Scotch,89,261,"2011 saw the first expression of rosebank appear in diageo’s annual special releases series, and just 5,604 bottles are available worldwide. the bottling is comprised of whisky matured in refill american oak and refill european oak casks. floral and mildly herbal on the nose, with cereal and tropical fruit notes, along with a hint of damp soil. the palate is somewhat tart, with oranges and pepper, while the finish dries to coffee and spicy oak. a lovely example of a much-mourned malt. "
"scapa 25 year old, 54%",Single Malt Scotch,89,300,"a limited edition of 2000 bottles. thick and syrupy on the palate, accentuated with vanilla and shortbread. you’ll also find pleasing peaches & cream, zingy citrus fruit, along with a hint of nuts, spice, and a pinch of salt on the palate. a nice addition to the 14 year old distillery bottling. kudos for bottling it at cask strength. 
"
"signatory, (distilled at springbank) 1969 vintage, 34 year old, 54.4% abv",Single Malt Scotch,89,485,"older springbanks are becoming hard to find, and this one won't disappoint. it is packed with citrus notes (lemon, orange) often found in whiskies over 30 years old. along with them you'll find subtle spice notes (especially cinnamon), red licorice, polished oak, and that signature springbank fresh brininess, albeit a bit reserved. this springbank is not as heavily sherried as some other older bottlings that have come and gone. if i wanted to be picky, i would like to see more of the springbank briny zest and freshness here, but, giving its age, it is understandably reserved. this whisky's best feature is how surprisingly clean, rounded, and polished it is for 33 years old. very nice."
"springbank 11 year old, 58%",Single Malt Scotch,89,105,"finished in a rum cask. gently sweet (caramel, vanilla cream, kiss of honey), with balancing fruit (lime, kiwi, green grape) and spice (white pepper, brine). youthful (but not immature). invigorating briny finish. i don’t know what kind of rum cask was used, but it comes across more like sugar cane juice-based rhum agricole than the molasses-based rums. very nice! (a park avenue liquor exclusive.) "
"springbank refill sherry 17 year old, 57%",Single Malt Scotch,89,200,"even with a refill sherry cask, bright fruit is the main theme to this whisky: strawberry-rhubarb pie, red raspberry preserve, red currant. but there’s honeyed malt for balance, along with suggestions of
coconut macaroon, marzipan, brine, and glazed ginger to keep things interesting. distinctive. (u.s. exclusive)"
"springbank marrying strength 10 year old, 49.9%",Single Malt Scotch,89,66,"a number of ‘marrying strength’ variants of 10 year old springbank have been released, retailing exclusively through the cadenhead whisky shop in campbeltown. the 2014 expression is bottled at 49.9%. brine, new leather, and pipe tobacco on the nose, with developing caramel. maritime characteristics are accentuated with time. voluptuous on the palate, balanced, with sweet leather, peaty spices, and apricots. long and slowly drying in the finish, with black pepper and rock salt. quintessential springbank, and the best 10 year old sampled to date. £42"
"springbank sherry wood 17 year old, 52.3%",Single Malt Scotch,89,130,"released in february 2015, this cask strength expression of 17 year old springbank has been entirely matured in sherry casks. 9,120 bottles are available globally. the nose offers sea spray, blood orange, ginger, and discreet sherry. finally, some peat. the sherry really makes its presence felt on the palate, which is full and slightly oily, with rich fruitcake flavors, soft toffee, coffee, and ripe cherries. the finish is lengthy, slightly peaty, with more sherry, treacle toffee, and trademark springbank ozone."
"gordon & macphail (distilled at strathisla) 40 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,89,200,"deep amber color. mature aroma-this is definitely an old whisky -with complex wood spices (cedar, vanilla, mint, caramel) and soft ripe fruit. medium bodied and soft. surprisingly balanced on the palate with an incredible depth and maturity. its flavors are similar to its aroma, but a soft sweetness compliments the flavors and provides balance. soothing, mellowing finish of considerable depth. 
"
"talisker 25 year old, 57.8%",Single Malt Scotch,89,225,"more subtle and teasing. not as much a knock-out punch on the finish like the talisker 10 and 18, but rather more steady intense blows to the abdomen for many rounds. an aging talisker, but still with many redeeming qualities. it is drier than its younger siblings, with less fruit and more of a stony texture, with dried spices and lingering leather notes. this whisky requires more patience and demands more concentration, but it is still rewarding to the seasoned aficionado (with some extra pocket change). 
"
"talisker, 30 year old, 50.7%",Single Malt Scotch,89,350,"a graceful talisker. soft toffee and caramel with balanced, gentle fruit. hints of boat dock wood, damp peat, and fish nets. warming spice notes (anise, pepper, and salt) provide intrigue and linger on through a warming, spicy finish. well rounded, with enough depth on the palate to make up for the lack of punch in younger expressions.
"
"talisker storm, 45.8%",Single Malt Scotch,89,61,"diageo has introduced this new no age statement variant of talisker single malt. the name reflects the distiller’s aspiration to enhance the maritime notes in this expression. refill and rejuvenated casks have both contributed to its maturation. the nose is youthful but rounded, with brine, burning wood embers, vanilla, and honey. sweet and spicy on the palate, with cranberries and black currants, while peat smoke is always present, plus black pepper. the finish lingers, with walnuts and fruity peat. £40"
"talisker dark storm, 45.8%",Single Malt Scotch,89,72,"described as the smokiest whisky produced at talisker, dark storm is exclusive to travel retail outlets, and maturation has taken place in deeply charred casks. rich, fruity spices on the nose, quite citric, with brine and aromatic smoke. the smoke elbows its way to the fore in time. full, sweet, fruity flavors on the palate, some vanilla, then smoke, licorice, and spice hit home. a classic talisker smoke and chili finish, but cranked up a notch or two! £45/1 liter"
"tamdhu 10 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,89,52,"a very welcome arrival from new owners ian macleod, this has been aged in sherry
wood. as a result, you can’t help comparing it to macallan and while there’s
none of the oily depths, there are fragrant top notes of honey and apple before
some resin and warm leather develop, but no sulfur. some of the richness is
lost with water, so i’d leave it as is. this is a stunner for a 10 year old and
is marked accordingly. value pick £34  "
"tomintoul, 33 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,89,290,"younger tomintoul whiskies are fairly straightforward, unassuming whiskies. older expressions show more depth. what they all seem to have is a remarkable balance. moreover, this whisky and its predecessor, the 27 year old, are surprisingly delicate and nimble for their age. this is an elegant whisky, with a toffee foundation, creamy vanilla, nougat, light summer fruits, a kiss of molasses, and gentle spice (cinnamon, mocha). soft finish. very pleasing.
"
"tomatin cù bòcan 1988 limited edition, 51.5%",Single Malt Scotch,89,262,"tomatin released this 28 year old expression under its cù bòcan label. this cask strength variant was matured in refill hogsheads and refill sherry butts that previously contained heavily-peated islay single malt. the nose is sweet and fruity, with apples and pears, background vanilla, and sweet, light smoke. the palate is voluptuous and sherry-sweet, with chili peppers and subtle, earthy peat smoke. the finish is slowly drying, with persistent spice, nuts, and smoke. (2,200 bottles) £200"
"scotch malt whisky society (28:23) 21 year old, 57.5%",Single Malt Scotch,89,140,"this bottling of tullibardine was distilled in november 1989 and has been matured in a refill sherry butt. the u.s. allocation is 120 bottles. initially, damp earth on the nose, sweetening to milk chocolate-covered fudge and vanilla, along with hazelnuts. notes of plum and black pepper with time. the palate is fruity, with toffee, spice, and cedar wood notes. long in the finish, with cereal and spicy resin. "
"duncan taylor (distilled at mosstowie), cask #5814, 30 year old, 48.1%",Single Malt Scotch,89,275,"part of the “rarest of the rare” collection. mosstowie was a limited production using lomond stills for a brief time at the miltonduff distillery. very pale in color for a 30 year old whisky, and creamy on the palate. a very clean whisky. bright fruit (apricot, lemon, sultana) and vanilla are the main flavors, with more subtle grass and hay notes. soothing finish."
"oban 21 year old, 58.5%",Single Malt Scotch,89,625,"the first diageo special releases oban to be released since 2004 has been matured in rejuvenated american oak and second-fill bodega casks. the outturn is 2,860 bottles. tinned peaches, ginger, caramel, and newly-sawn wood on the nose, with an accompanying marine note. syrupy in the mouth, very sweet and spicy, with nutmeg, cinnamon, and baked apple. contrast is provided by a splash of brine. spicy in the drying finish, with ginger to the fore, plus more sea salt."
"cutty sark storm, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,89,31,"cutty sark master blender kirsteen campbell has hit the ground running and is playing a leading role in the revival of this iconic blend. storm is a very different whisky than tam o' shanter. the nose is nuanced and light, with orange jelly and citrus juice; the palate is sophisticated, fruity, perfectly balanced, rounded, and gentle, with a high-percentage malt content evident in the mix. the finish is quite short but very more-ish. an amazing whisky for the price. £20 value pick"
"cutty sark 18 year old, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,89,80,"cutty sark lost its way in recent years; expect that to change soon. its owners have plans to return it to glory (and to include a 30 year old among its expressions — you read it here first). for the time being — if you can find it — this 18 year old is a sublime mix of soft plum and peach, sweet, pure grain, easy-drinking vanilla, and a deft oakiness all delivered in gentle and harmonious fashion. masterful blending."
"cutty sark cask strength, 51.4%",Blended Scotch Whisky,89,53,"blended whiskies have taken a sexy turn for the better, and there have been some excellent attempts to innovate. indeed, a gap has opened up between main label blends and this sort of thing, which is particularly brave because a world-class brand has let amateurs loose on it. that said, this is massive, with big earthy spice, peat, and sour fruits. there's some youthful sappiness in the mix, too, but it's not detrimental. brave and impressive.  "
"wemyss malts ‘winter spice’ single cask, 44.4%",Single Malt Scotch,89,172,"this cask strength, 29 year old 1982 expression in the wemyss malts range is the company’s first bottling of a single malt distilled at the northern highland distillery of teaninich. just 201 bottles have been released. the insistently fruity nose features overripe pears, heather in bloom, soft fudge, salted popcorn, cinnamon, and ginger. soft and peachy on the palate, with darker spice notes, walnuts, and plain chocolate. the finish is lengthy, with more plain chocolate and some spiced oak. £110"
"wemyss malts cacao geyser (distilled at bowmore) 1998, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,124,"rich amber. a slight agricultural note to start, and although sweet and soft, also a little indistinct. this is a palate whisky, with plenty of integrated smoke, rich fruitcake, and, as its name suggests, plenty of chocolate. it fades quickly when neat. water, surprisingly, rectifies this: the nose opens to show complex dark depths, while the palate is lengthened and given extra aromatic lift. rich and rather lovely. £85"
"wemyss malts kiln embers, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,89,64,"this is so much more than a pumped-up version of peat chimney; this has sweet smoke from singed green wood twigs, light honey, peach, all balanced with tcp-soaked bandages. nothing harsh or off-putting, it’s just a delight. sweet honey, orange, generous malt, and caramel, but it’s the smoke coiling its way throughout that makes the greatest impression on the palate and finish. these blended malts tend to move quickly, so grab one while you can. perfect for winter drinking. (12,000 bottles) £42"
" port askaig 110° proof, 55%",Single Malt Scotch,89,75,"a u.s.-exclusive variant of this popular islay single malt. lemon juice and warm granite on the nose, backed by sweet heather, ginger, and developing jaffa orange, medicinal peat, and charcuterie. mouth-coating and initially sweet, before darker berry notes emerge. savory, saline, and smoky. medium-length in the finish, with lingering peat smoke and spicy oak."
"black bull, 12 year old, 50%",Blended Scotch Whisky,89,50,"quite rich and chewy, with nutty toffee, vanilla fudge, nougat, chocolate cake, orchard fruit, and black cherry—all on a solid malty foundation. this isn’t one of those elegant, lighter-flavored blends with a high grain whisky content. the focus here is on fullness of flavor. a blend for the malt whisky drinker (but should also appeal to the more open-minded blend drinker, too)."
"kilchoman spring 2011 release, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,65,"a marriage of 3 and 4 year old whisky aged in first-fill bourbon barrels, with the 4 year old portion being finished in oloroso sherry casks. among the best of the kilchoman releases to date. the first-fill bourbon packs a flavor punch, while the sherry softens, rounds, and adds complexity. barrel char, burnt raisin, boat dock, and tarry rope, softened by caramel and enhanced with notes of tropical fruit. surprisingly mature for its age and very distinctive. "
"kilchoman 100% islay 7th edition, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,89,100,"as with previous releases, the 7th edition of 100% islay is produced from barley grown and malted at the distillery. matured in fresh and refill buffalo trace bourbon barrels filled in 2010. smoky ripe pears, wood preservative, vanilla, and apple purée on the nose. fresh citrus fruit, buttery toffee, and ashy peat on the palate. the lengthy finish features licorice and cigarette ash."
" teaninich 17 year old (diageo special releases 2017), 55.9%",Single Malt Scotch,89,310,"distilled in 1999, this single malt was aged in refill american oak hogsheads and refill american oak barrels. pineapple and walnuts figure on the early nose, which becomes more floral, ultimately offering violets. the palate is full and fruity, majoring in peaches in syrup, with new-mown hay and white pepper. nicely balanced and rounded, with buttery notes emerging. the finish dries slowly, with subtle licorice."
"signatory (distilled at balmenach) 1988, 55.6%",Single Malt Scotch,89,140,"it’s a crying shame that this great distillery is so rarely seen. here, a bourbon cask has reduced the meatiness and amplified the fruity component, but these are fruits with depth and power, allied to dried flowers. the mango-like sweetness is reduced to syrup; there’s light plum jam and some old paper. sweet on the tongue, with crystallized ginger, apricot, and a finish of spice, and the strange sweetness of licorice root. (the whisky exchange only.) £84"
"auchroisk 20 year old, 58.1%",Single Malt Scotch,89,175,"poor old auchroisk. not only couldn’t anyone pronounce it correctly (it’s “oth rusk,” in case you’re interested), but in recent years it’s seen its singleton prefix hijacked by other larger distilleries — glendullan, dufftown, glen ord — leaving it somewhat forgotten by malt mavens. part of the old j&b stable, it continues to make a malty/nutty spirit, a style which is also somewhat out of favor in the world of single malts. 
maybe this bottling (in a rather spiffing retro pack) will redress the balance. the color is full gold, and though initially the nose shows the high bottling strength to the max, beneath the prickly heat is eucalyptus oil alongside those signature nutty/cereal notes. but here’s the difference; there’s sweetness, too: toffee and thick clover honey, even a touch of sawdust and pencil shavings before a drop of water brings out malted milk and powdered hazelnut. in other words, there’s plenty of distillery character, but good cask development. 
in the mouth, when neat, the needling alcohol slightly numbs the tongue and the effect from start to finish is a bit fragmented. add water, however (not too much), and there’s a soft, creamy effect across the tongue with praline, almond, and a dark chocolate note as well. be careful with the water though, as you need to retain the zesty acidity on the finish. "
"the naked grouse, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,89,35,"this is the latest spinoff from core blend the famous grouse, so there’s macallan and highland park in here, and from the taste of it, in sizeable quantities. with smart but minimalist packaging and an environmental theme, this is a very ‘now’ whisky. it’s heavily sherried, very rich, and sweet, but there’s enough spice to stop it becoming cloying, and it’s as soft as a down feather blanket on the palate. you can easily drink it straight, too.  "
"speyburn 25 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,89,300,"the oldest expression available from speyburn, this has been aged in a mix of american oak fino sherry and bourbon casks, and is non-chill filtered. vanilla, honey, lemon, and spice on the fragrant nose. quite full-bodied and creamy on the palate; nutty, with malt, honey, and citrus fruit. the citrus fruit becomes spicier in the medium-length, oaky finish."
"singleton of glendullan 18 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,89,70,"of the three singleton bottlings, dufftown is aimed at european markets, glen ord at asia, and glendullan at the u.s. the oldest expression in the singleton of glendullan stable, this boasts a nose of brittle toffee, dried fruits, and new leather. nutty toffee, drinking chocolate, banana split, and coconut on the smooth, soft palate. peppery almonds in the slowly drying finish. good value for the money!"
"ballantine’s 30 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,89,380,"the nose unravels with milk chocolate, thick hazelnut spread, and a slender twist of orange peel, though that delectable goodness is evenly balanced with peppermint patties and detectable light, floral top notes. this has a lush softness, with a perceptibly slow crescendo of flavors incorporating caramel toffee, popcorn, and chocolate praline. it’s beautifully integrated with a smooth, dense texture, and releases its grip reluctantly with just a whisper of a peppermint reprise."
"ballantine’s 17 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,89,69,"malt biscuits, runny caramel, blended black tea, melting butter sliding across a hot skillet, the leather uppers on new oxfords, and a more enjoyable waft of peat smoke than expected. clean, light flavors; lime jelly, root ginger, initially not overly sweet, then a boost of honey, caramelized fruits, with toffee and cocoa later still. it’s pricked with hints of smoke throughout, with a long finish of pepper and other spices. perfectly enjoyable anytime."

"balblair 1997, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,85,"following the initial release of a 1997 vintage balblair in 2007, a second edition has now been launched, with the spirit in question having benefited from an additional five years’ maturation in first-fill bourbon barrels. fresh, light, and fruity on the nose: tinned peaches, pear drops, sweet apples, plus vanilla and wood putty. the palate features lots of succulent soft fruits, milk chocolate, honey, and spice. the finish is medium in length, and spicy chocolate notes persist. £55 "
"the balvenie, 17 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,90,"the balvenie continues its limited edition releases of 17 year old whiskies. previous editions included an islay cask finish and a new oak finish. this is the newest one, aged in sherry oak casks. it’s a delicious whisky, with clean, ripe, sherried fruit marrying nicely with the dry oak spices. notes of apple pie, honeyed summer fruit, caramel toasted almonds, and toffee, with dry resinous oak on the finish to round out the sweetness. a big, full-bodied balvenie that satisfies. 
"
"balvenie 40 year old (batch #2), 48.5%",Single Malt Scotch,88,3982,"the darkness of the hue of this, the second official release of a 40 year old from balvenie, gives an indication of how intense the relationship between cask and spirit has been over its long sequestration. it emerges brimming with dense aromas such as tamarind paste, treacle, and black forest gateau. amazingly, on the palate there’s a lift of vanilla-like sweetness before the heavier and drier elements close down on the finish. incredibly limited; only 150 bottles produced. £2,500"
"balvenie single barrel traditional oak 25 year old, 47.8%",Single Malt Scotch,88,599,"light gold, with good intensity and a more noticeable malty note than is common with this distillery, as well as touches of daffodil and dried honeycomb. the wood influence appears minimal to start with, but more vanilla creeps through in time; water brings out almond milk. opens into clementine peel, pomelo, then cooked dessert apple. the palate is clean and forward; even slightly hot when neat. remarkably assertive for a 25 year old."
"balvenie peat week  14 year old, 48.3%",Single Malt Scotch,88,99,"this expression dates from 2002, when balvenie first produced a batch of heavily peated malt. matured in american oak casks, the nose exhibits subtle peat balanced by honey, vanilla, and ripe red apples. on the palate, the soft smoke is well integrated with vanilla, more honey, ginger, and overripe pears. ashy peat, citrus fruits, cinnamon, and tangy oak in the finish. an elegant peated whisky."
"ben nevis 15 year old 1998 (cask #590), 57.3%",Single Malt Scotch,88,140,"this 2014 bottling of ben nevis illustrates how good the single malt can be with robust sherry cask maturation. distilled in june 1998, it was filled into a fresh sherry butt and matured for 15 years before 582 bottles were released. raisins, prunes, old polished leather, and roasted meat on the nose. the body is full, with the palate offering succulent dark berries, dates, raisins, and plain chocolate. long and spicy in the finish, with cloves and rum raisin-flavored dark chocolate. £92"
"benriach authenticus 25 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,195,"though sounding more like a character out of asterix than a whisky, authenticus is the code for the peated arm of the ever-expanding benriach portfolio. it’s the smoke that you notice first, typically highland-style wood smoke with a light aromatic lift akin to smoked meat. it’s not a bludgeoning smoke however, because benriach’s inherent orchard fruit sweetness is there alongside touches of beeswax. in other words, it has maturity. the key here is balance and harmony. £124"
"benriach 10 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,50,"this new member of the core range is wholly from stock produced by the distillery’s new(ish) owner. it has a gentle, sweet, honeycomb nose, with some banana, a little malt, and lemon freshness. the palate shows light honey/honeysuckle at the start and is well balanced, with maltiness and a signature spicy finish adding a dry counterpoint to the sweetness from the cask and a distillate with good weight. good price as well. lovely."
"benriach pedro ximenez sherry wood finish 15 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,100,"as the name implies, this non-chill filtered expression was finished in pedro ximinez sherry butts. the nose offers sweet sherry, honey, malt, and lemon, while the palate yields more sherry, plain chocolate, honey, spicy toffee, and a hint of orange. more spicy toffee, plus drying oak in the medium-length finish."
"benromach, 24 year old, 58.6%",Single Malt Scotch,88,160,"this whisky combines the finer qualities of both the 18 year old and the 25 year old. it expresses the balance and purity of the 18 year old, while showing maturity found in the 25 year old. the lack of chill-filtering enhances the whisky’s vibrancy and, like all the benromachs, it’s mouth-coatingly thick and malty. 
"
"benromach, 10 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,50,"the first 10 year old release containing whisky produced entirely by the new owners. i love the interplay here between the malt, sherry, and smoke, with all getting a chance to shine. a rich vanilla-tinged malty foundation, deep caramel, rhum agricole, an array of lush fruit and dark chocolate, along with grassy/hay notes, honeysuckle, subtle spice (cinnamon, anise), and lingering earthy smoke. a vast improvement from the “origins” release last year. i would only make three changes to make this whisky even better (and elevate it to 90+ status): a couple more years on oak, bottling at 46%, and not chill-filtering it. still, this is one of the best efforts from this distillery. well done!
"
"benromach heritage collection 35 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,610,"another example of the old ‘strathspey’ style of whisky, which predates the lighter, more estery/floral style we have become accustomed to. here, distillery weight and time work in tandem to give a nose that has slightly overripe orchard fruits, smoke, and seville orange. the palate then heads into the hedgerows—hawthorn and currant jam—before a waxiness emerges. the finish reveals a mix of smoke and mint. all in all, an excellent dram. £425"
"scott selection (distilled at bladnoch) vintage, 59%",Single Malt Scotch,88,75,"gold color. citrus zest aromas and creamy sweet notes-reminiscent of lemon meringue pie-with subtle tropical fruit and marshmallow notes dancing throughout. this whisky has great balance and is fully mature at 12 yrs., which should be no surprise for a lowland whisky. the palate delivers what the aroma promises, with a touch of honey up front, citrus and vanilla in the middle, and a delicate dryness on the finish. i've always admired bladnoch-a whisky that needs to be better known-and this expression reinforces my opinion."
"scotch malt whisky society (50:42) 18 year old, 56.9%",Single Malt Scotch,88,130,"distilled in scotland’s most southerly distillery of bladnoch in october 1992, this bottling has been matured in a refill hogshead, and 150 bottles have been allocated to the u.s. it presents a fresh nose, with initial herbal notes, turning to cornflakes and newly-mown hay. sweet and fruity on the palate, with oat biscuits and milk chocolate. the finish is relatively short, with spicy custard, then a final fruit flourish. "
"bladnoch talia 25 year old, 49.2%",Single Malt Scotch,88,385,"the revival of bladnoch distillery in southwest scotland continues, with the launch of 15 and 25 year old expressions to add to the nas samsara (reviewed winter 2016). talia has been finished in new american oak casks. sweet and floral on the nose, with violets, jaffa orange, and fragrant fresh oak. medium to full-bodied, with rich fruit notes, praline, malt, and finally, raisins and prunes. dark oak in the long, mouth-drying finish."
"bowmore tempest (second release), 10 year old, 56%",Single Malt Scotch,88,100,"the first tempest to be imported to the u.s. aged exclusively in first-fill bourbon casks. with the bourbon cask, and relatively young age, you can really feel all the islay love. bracing, with plenty of sea character, along with honeyed vanilla, citrus, floral notes (especially lavender), rumbling peat smoke, tobacco, and resinous oak on the finish.  a bit steep in price for a 10 year old, but very dynamic."
"exclusive malts (distilled at bowmore) 2001, 58.4%",Single Malt Scotch,88,120,"a sweet start, then a sudden blast of fresh, menthol-like toothpaste (pleasant) before it dips into slightly decaying soft fruits (again, nice), a mashy note, then violet-accented smoke. water adds some elegance and weight. this sweetness continues on the palate, where there’s toffee, raisin, ripe fruits, and slow-burning peatiness, fully integrated and ember-like on the back palate. the finish is all hot peppered mackerel. recommended. (u.s. only)"
"signatory (distilled at brora) 18 year old, 1983, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,65,"pale gold/straw color. fresh, appetizing aroma and flavor of brine, delicate peat, gentle sweetness, and a touch of spice and seaweed. medium in body and slightly oily in texture. nicely balanced and clean, with a salty, dryish finish. this is a lovely, very appetizing expression of a distillery that has been closed and dismantled. (it was the original clynelish distillery.) it is a very nice example of a northern highland whisky, and expresses a great balance between sweetness and brine, youth and maturity. however, i would have liked to have seen it bottled at a higher strength."
"elements of islay pl1 (distilled at bruichladdich, port charlotte style), 60%",Single Malt Scotch,88,101,"part of an ongoing series, and the first appearance of port charlotte. this ain’t shy. assertive with banana, roasted red pepper, paprika, and a hit of barbecued pork glazed with pomegranate molasses. the palate has blazing heat, but also oiliness and real density. the peat doesn’t so much rumble as sit there in a cloud: opaque, impenetrable. even water cannot unlock it. rooty and tarry, this is not a dram for the fainthearted. £65 (500 ml)"
"exclusive malts (distilled at bunnahabhain) 26 year old 1987 cask # 2784, 47.8%",Single Malt Scotch,88,230,"peated whiskies definitely have a dropping off point where they become too old and tired, and the nose for this one would indicate it’s past its prime, with gravel, rubbery smoke, and raisin. on the palate it’s a different story, as ashy smoke combines with raisin and rancio, turning the peat age detriment into an asset. strangely alluring, it’s like sitting on a park bench next to a weathered old man who ends up having a real tale to tell.  (u.s. only)"
"bunnahabhain toiteach, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,66,"dried peat smoke, a papery column of cigar ash, sizzling bacon fat, baked earth, and a shower of sea spray, coupled with hints of fresh peach and ripe fruits. the palate has a light, oily consistency ingrained with smokiness throughout, tasting of vanilla toffee, pick ‘n’ mix foam bananas, tangy citrus, and sweet tropical fruits, the whole arrangement given a peppery lift before succumbing to a late nuttiness. it’s not named after the gaelic for smoky for nothing, you know."
"bunnahabhain pedro ximénez cask finish 15 year old, 54.3%",Single Malt Scotch,88,99,"this was matured in second-fill sherry casks and then spent 3 years in first-fill pedro ximénez butts. the nose features fruit and nutty milk chocolate, fudge, sultanas, and mixed candied peel. lush, sweet sherry on the palate, with a carryover of fudge and sultanas from the nose. long in the nutty, spicy finish, which offers nutmeg and peppery oak. (5,000 bottles)"
"caol ila, 12 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,50,"like the clynelish 14 year old also reviewed in this issue, it is nice to see diageo finally introduce official distillery bottlings of caol ila here in the u.s. (after being available in the uk for many years now). my suitcases were getting quite heaving on my return trips from scotland. this is a splendid coal ila. it is wonderfully vibrant. understandably, the immediate impact on the palate is the peat smoke, but there's so much else going on here, too: smoked olives, seaweed, salt and pepper, all placed on a gently sweet bed of toffee and vanilla fudge. lingering smoke, olives, and seaweed on the finish."
"gordon & macphail (distilled at caol ila) 15 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,88,85,"amber gold color. an exciting aroma-classic islay. it is very phenolic, reminiscent of standing downwind of a peat kiln. interwoven spice (especially pepper), seaweed, and sweet & sour notes add complexity. light to medium in body, but quite oily. nicely balanced flavors of peat smoke, seaweed, salt & pepper, all wrapped up in a gentle sweetness. lingering peat smoke and spice on the finish. yet another example of caol ila's fine pedigree. this bottling has great balance, and i especially enjoy how the smoke and sweetness marry together. my only criticism is that it is a bit soft for caol ila. i would love to try this whisky at 46 or 50% abv, which would give it a bit more guts."
"caol ila 25 year old, 59.4%",Single Malt Scotch,88,225,"a rounded and mature affair. the 25 years in oak has made it a bit more refined (and drier on the palate) compared to younger expressions. all the classic caol ila notes are stillthere-mustard, seaweed, olives, damp peat, salt and pepper. a touch of vanilla wafer, anise, smoked almonds, and tarry rope add complexity. those of you who prefer ardbeg 17 over the 10, and laphroaig 15 over the 10, will be attracted to this whisky when compared to caol ila's younger siblings. but at $225, it's an expensive date, isn't it?"
"jewels of scotland (distilled at caol ila), 1984 vintage, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,88,170,"bottled in 2004 and still in circulation. a very traditional caol ila. not a heavy-bodied whisky, but it throws a strong punch. notes of tarry rope infused with seaweed and brine, all on an oily, malty, vanilla foundation. throw in some orchard fruit, manzanilla olive, black licorice stick, and soot, with brine and tellicherry pepper on the finish. clean, fun, and dynamic.
"
"caol ila 'unpeated style,' 10 year old (2009 release), 65.8%",Single Malt Scotch,88,60,"caol ila makes unpeated whisky for blenders, but it rarely gets bottled as a single malt. here’s a very revealing opportunity to find out what caol ila tastes like without the smoke. good viscosity and rather sweet, showing thick, honeyed vanilla, gobs of fruit (lemon drops, lime tart, ripe bartlett pear, kiwi), mint jelly, and cut grass. its sea influence finally emerges towards the finish with brine and just a hint of seaweed. bruichladdich and bunnahabhain are now bottling peated whiskies, and caol ila does just the opposite. this is an interesting diversion, but i am missing the added dimension of peat smoke in this caol ila.
"
"caol ila, 25 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,205,"this is to be a permanent addition to the core caol ila range, but it will raise a few eyebrows, completely ignoring the current peat battle between ardbeg and bruichladdich and heading off into an altogether more refined and delicate direction. this is a dignified and complex malt, which doesn’t give everything up immediately. there’s soft pear and guava on the nose, and the trademark oiliness and distinctive peat are there, but there’s a buttery quality, too, as well as some brine and spice, apple pip, and traces of aniseed. you get a sense of its age late on, with some oaky tannins and sharper spice, but overall this is an unhurried, complex, and sweet whisky with just enough peat to keep it honest. very impressive. (limited general releases, excluding the u.s.) "
"caol ila 12 year old, 57.6%",Single Malt Scotch,88,79,"unusual, insofar as this is the one chance a year that drinkers get to try caol ila’s other expression: the unpeated version, which — and here’s a bit of history for you — helped save the distillery during the lean period of the whisky loch in the early 80s. rather than this just being caol ila with the peat stripped out, the team made  it in a different fashion — but there are still hints of commonality. 
for example, the grassy note that usually lies beneath the smoke is the lead aroma here, and it’s not any old grass, but wet grass — like skidding on a football (soccer) field. the mind keeps looking for smoke, but apart from a hint of birch smoke (which could come from the (refill) cask), it’s whistle-clean and fruity, and with a touch of water, fills with an aroma of toffee popcorn, custard, and pears. 
the palate continues in this light fashion with melon balls and fruit cocktail. this potentially bland fleshiness is given a perkiness thanks to the high alcohol and, again, a jag of acidity. bizarrely, on the finish, i pick up slight saltiness. a fun dram. "
"caol ila 18 year old (diageo special releases 2017), 59.8%",Single Malt Scotch,88,100,"this unpeated version of caol ila was matured in refill american oak hogsheads. the nose is quite reticent, with subtle vanilla and milk chocolate notes. big, fizzy-sweet fruit notes on the palate, with caramel, rock pools, hot spices, plain chocolate, and very mild wood smoke. bubble gum and peppery chocolate in the medium-length finish."
"mackillop's choice (distilled at caperdonich), 35 year old, 1968 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,165,"caperdonich is always a challenge to find. this one is aged in a sherry cask. one would fear that slumbering away for 35 years in a sherry cask would completely dominate this whisky’s profile. not this whisky. as you would expect, it is nicely matured, but it is surprisingly clean and well rounded, too! exotic notes of dried fruits, sultana, subtle (but viscous) honey, sandalwood, and a potpourri of spice (especially cinnamon, anise, ginger). clean, subtly spicy finish. slowly sip and savor its delicate pleasures. 
"
"master of malt darkness! clynelish 16 year old oloroso cask finish, 54.9%",Single Malt Scotch,88,126,"darkness! is a range of cask strength single malts which have been finished for 3 months in 50-liter first-fill oloroso or pedro ximénez casks. waxy on the nose, with dates, prunes, cherries, cocoa powder, window polish, and finally vanilla. warm and spicy on the palate, with sweet sherry, hot chocolate, intense tropical fruit notes, and cloves. the fruit becomes more citric in the finish; nutty, with clove oil. £75"
"clynelish select reserve (diageo special release 2014), 54.9%",Single Malt Scotch,88,800,"this clynelish is notable as the first no age statement special release, and maturation took place in refill european and bodega european oak casks, along with first-fill, refill, and rejuvenated american oak casks. the nose is fresh and salty, with olives, pine, and lemongrass, then fruit notes ranging from citric to sweet. oily on the palate, with those same citric and sweet fruits as the nose, plus cayenne pepper and vanilla. spicy citrus fruits in the drying finish."
"clynelish select reserve (diageo special releases 2015), 56.1%",Single Malt Scotch,88,815,"the maturation regime of this clynelish involves first-fill american oak barrels, rejuvenated and refill american oak hogsheads, plus bodega and refill european oak butts. the minimum age in the assemblage is 15 years, and 2,946 bottles are available.  a complex, perfumed nose, with scorched grass, developing vanilla fudge, and freshly-peeled orange. classic clynelish waxiness on the palate, with toffee, more orange, peach, digestive biscuits, cinnamon, and developing pepper. the lengthy, creamy finish features chocolate-coated orange candy and ginger."
"the dalmore, 15 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,88,80,"those who are fond of ripe, sherried whiskies will enjoy this new 15 year old. it’s aged entirely in sherry casks. the sherry is nicely layered (but not sappy or cloying) and the dalmore spirit is big enough to handle it. lush fruit, richly textured and fleshy, with a warming spice impact on the finish. orange marmalade, glazed citrus, and key lime pie are enveloped by sweet toffee/molasses notes, and spiced with cinnamon, clove, ginger, and subtle chocolate. soothing and restorative in nature. good for after dinner -- or with a cigar."
"the dalmore 1263 king alexander iii, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,88,200,"master blender richard paterson’s excellent adventure. this whisky consists of dalmore aged in a wide variety of casks, including cabernet sauvignon, madeira, matusalem sherry, marsala, port, and bourbon. this diversity shows in the whisky’s complexity and unique flavor profile. there’s a lot going on in here. very rich, but balanced with oak spice and gripping resin (especially on the finish). sweet layers of toffee, molasses, and vanilla fudge provide a foundation for red plum, ripe red raspberry, black cherry, blueberry, orange marmalade, kiwi, grape skin, and toasted almond. a very busy whisky which requires a good dose of mental participation to really appreciate it and sort all the flavors out. in this regard, very much like glenmorangie signet."
"the dalmore cromartie, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,88,156,"the dalmore cromartie was distilled in 1996 and has been matured in oloroso sherry casks. the release is limited to 7,500 bottles.  a floral nose with cocoa powder and warm leather, along with hand-rolling tobacco and gingery, citrus notes. rich and elegant sherry notes on the palate, with soft, smoky treacle and dark chocolate-covered orange candy.  the finish is long and spicy, majoring on cinnamon, with more dark chocolate, overripe orange, and a hint of licorice. £100"
"dalmore distillery exclusive 2015, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,88,229,"just 450 bottles of this year’s offering are available. aged in a mixture of madeira, muscatel, and port casks, with a final spell in first-fill bourbon barrels. warm caramel, spiced orange, peach blossom, and black pepper on the complex nose. nicely textured on the palate; initially fondant-sweet, then nutmeg, jaffa orange, ginger, and milk chocolate emerge. relatively lengthy in the finish, with sultanas, leather, a hint of plain chocolate, and lingering black pepper. £150"
"dalmore 30 year old, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,88,2260,"following on from its limited edition 21 year old release, dalmore has introduced a 30 year old expression, with 888 numbered bottles being available. matured in a mix of matusalem oloroso and amoroso oloroso sherry butts sourced from the gonzales byass bodega.  the nose is slightly meaty, with coffee, sherry, and stewed apple. supple on the palate, with dark, spicy orange, black currant cordial, and marzipan. spicy tannins kick in during the very long, fruity, finally mouth-drying finish."
"mackillop's choice (distilled at glen ord), 21 year old, 1983 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,100,"lush and fruity-the sherry cask aging is obvious-and it is balanced beautifully by the dry, spicy oak notes. through all this, there’s inviting notes of ginger, raisin, and a whiff of peat. one of the best glen ord whiskies i’ve tasted. 
"
"wemyss malts merchant’s mahogany chest (distilled at glen scotia) 1991, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,95,"the latest single cask expression of 1991 glen scotia from wemyss malts has been matured for 22 years in a sherry butt, which yielded 807 bottles. the nose provides sherry and cigar boxes, cherries, sultanas, raisins, orange peel, plum pudding, and finally warm leather. full bodied, with sherry on the palate, plus brine, dried fruit, bitter coffee, and polished old, dark oak. medium to long in the fruity finish, with salt, plain chocolate, and wood polish notes. £105"
"glendronach, 1989 vintage, 19 year old, 58.7%",Single Malt Scotch,88,135,"the first single cask release of glendronach for the u.s. by the new owners, and a nice one at that. silky in texture, polished, and clean on the palate, with light toffee, treacle, cherry bonbon, orange-soaked date nut cake, and chocolate-covered raisin. never cloying, like some heavily-sherried whiskies can be. silky, soothing finish. surprisingly soft and youthful for its age. (a park avenue liquor exclusive.)"
"glendronach 14 year old virgin oak, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,90,"initially matured in recharred puncheons, then transferred for an unspecified period into virgin american oak casks. the nose offers icing sugar and soft toffee, vanilla, clementine, and wood varnish. more icing sugar, with orange and fudge on the palate, plus wood spice and an herbal note. fruity through the finish, while spice builds, with a hint of aniseed at the close. an interesting alternative to the classic sherry-rich glendronach style."
"glenfarclas family casks 1985 cask #2591, 45.4%",Single Malt Scotch,88,480,"a refill sherry hoggie has given a classic walnut color, and indeed notes of that nut as well. here’s glenfarclas at its most dense, with savory, sun-dried tomato-like edges and sandalwood. the mouth is elegant with a little heat, the sherry giving roasted almond, sweet plump dried fruits, and dried flowers. water brings out lightly gripping tannins (but, again, not aggressively) and good layering. similar to the ’87. £285"
"glenglassaugh massandra connection 35 year old madeira wood finish, 41.7%",Single Malt Scotch,88,665,"glenglassaugh initially imported massandra wine casks from the crimea in 2010 for finishing purposes, and that was the first time the winery had allowed its wood to be exported. in 2014, two massandra cask finishes were released. distilled in 1978, the madeira-finished nose yields dates, sultanas, stewed fruit, caramel, a hint of smoke, and spices. smooth on the palate, with apricots, cocoa powder, oak, and lots of spice development. the softly-oaked finish is lengthy, citric, and spicy. £395"
"glenglassaugh peated port wood finish, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,81,"glenglassaugh has launched its first cask-finished whiskies, matured for an unspecified period in first- fill american oak casks before finishing for up to 2 years in secondary casks. this is the pick of the quartet of expressions, with a nose of fragrant, fruity smoke, hand-rolling tobacco, and new leather. red berry fruits and woodsmoke feature on the palate, while the finish offers gentle peat smoke, cinnamon, and black pepper. £60"
"glengoyne 17 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,70,"probably the most highly-regarded malt in the regular glengoyne lineup, the 17 year old represents a direct progression from its younger siblings. according to the distillers, “the balance has artfully changed. a more concentrated palate of flavors has emerged…” citrus and cedar notes on the slightly grassy nose, with a hint of plain chocolate. medium in body, with more plain chocolate notes, plus raisins, orange, vanilla, and malt. lengthy in the finish, with milky coffee, sherry, leather, and citrus spice. "
"glengoyne 18 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,109,"this variant of glengoyne replaces the popular 17 year old as part of an overhaul of the core range, and the maturation regime has included what the distillers describe as “a generous proportion of first-fill sherry casks.” milk chocolate, vanilla, melon, and grapefruit on the nose, with burgeoning dry sherry and fruitcake. the palate is rich and well rounded, with cinnamon and ginger, almonds, orange marmalade, sweeter sherry, and caramel. lingering spices and easy-going oak in the lengthy finish.  £70"
"signatory (distilled at glenlivet), 25 year old, 1980 vintage, cask #13735, 53.9%",Single Malt Scotch,88,160,"very fragrant. spicy too, with notes of honeyed vanilla, peaches in cream, butterscotch, cinnamon, licorice (red and black), light nuttiness, and toasted oak on the finish. nice mouthfeel, well-balanced, and quite rich for such an elegant whisky. 
"
"peerless (distilled at glenlivet) 1968, 34 year old, 45.9%",Single Malt Scotch,88,95,"deep gold color. exotic aroma of tropical fruit (coconut, pineapple), vanilla, and honey. medium bodied and firm. on the palate: honey, vanilla, and tropical fruit up front, becoming dry, with subtly complex spice notes. deep, dry, lingering finish. 
"
"lonach (distilled at glenlivet), 34 year old, 1971 vintage, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,88,160,"lively on the nose for its age (and on the palate too -- the tell-tale oak emerges only towards the end). notes of creamy vanilla, barley sugar, coconut, pineapple, and general citrus notes throughout. dried spices (especially cinnamon) kick in mid-palate and continue into a lengthy, dry, polished oak finish."
"mackillop’s choice (distilled at glenlivet), 1977 vintage, 30 year old, (cask #19786), 43% ",Single Malt Scotch,88,180,"once again lorne mackillop demonstrates his talent for selecting whiskies with beautiful balance. this time it’s with a well-aged glenlivet. sure, it shows many of the notes that i often find in glenlivet (speyside elegance, peachy vanilla, tropical fruit, floral and honeyed-malt notes), but i’m also picking up more subtle notes: dark chocolate, licorice root, dark fruit, perhaps even charcoal (especially on the finish), making the whisky a bit more complex and curiously attractive."
"glenlivet 18 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,100,"there’s no doubt that this is from glenlivet; there’s still that pure combination of fruit and flowers, now given a little nudge toward a more concentrated expression: the flowers are dried and heathery, the fruits tinned pineapple, windfall apples. an added cedar/nutmeg note adds to the complexity. liquorous and tongue-clinging with custard tart notes before the autumn fruits come through. a sense of the curtains being drawn and a settling in for the winter. recommended."
"glenmorangie, 15 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,57,"deep gold color. this whisky is finished off in new oak, and it certainly shows. there are lots of complex wood spices in this whisky, and it is intensely deep and mature for such a young age. there’s a firmness to the whisky that’s very appealing. it is exciting too, with notes of toasted oak, vanilla, and a hint of dark chocolate. 
"
"glenmorangie signet, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,205,"this is unlike any glenmorangie i’ve ever tasted. it’s a very textural, visceral whisky -- partly due to the chocolate malt, partly due to the casks used. it’s dark in color for a glenmorangie, and viscous on the palate, with interwoven notes of dark chocolate, ground coffee, pot still rum, and spice (cinnamon, nutmeg), followed by dry polished leather, tobacco leaf, and a roasted walnut finish. this is a fun whisky, and earns bonus points for being unique in flavor. but i think its dry, slightly assertive finish detracts from what otherwise is a thrilling, dynamic journey."
"glenmorangie finealta, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,80,"glenmorangie enters the world of peated whiskies (like everyone else these days it seems — not that i’m complaining). richly textured layers of sweetness (vanilla, toffee, milk chocolate), fruit (tangerine, orchard fruit — especially ripe cherry), roasted nuts, wild morels, a hint of menthol, and gentle smoke. certainly entertaining, even if the whisky doesn’t always seem to know what it wants to be. the soft sweetness mid-palate is balanced nicely by dried spice and smoke on the finish. curiously enjoyable. "
"glenmorangie 15 year old nectar d’or, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,62,"previously offered as a 12 year old, it now has an extra three years of secondary maturation, after a decade in ex-bourbon casks. the ‘finishing’ casks are ex-sauternes barriques. lemonade, icing sugar, vanilla, nougat, and maple on the nose. progressively sweeter. rich and sweet on the palate, notably fruity, with spicy orange and brittle toffee. medium length finish, with milk chocolate-coated ginger and lingering toffee. £39"
"glenmorangie artein, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,80,"artein is the third release in glenmorangie’s private edition range, with ‘artein’ being gaelic for stone. the expression comprises two-thirds 15 year old and one-third 21 year old whisky, finished in ‘super tuscan’ wine casks. briefly pear drops, then vanilla on the nose, with developing peaches and apricots, shot through with mild ginger. viscous, mouth-coating, intense, dark fruits, spice, aniseed, and late onset of cloves and blackcurrant cough medicine on the palate. the finish is fruity, long, and herbal."
"glenmorangie tùsail, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,111,"tùsail—apparently gaelic for ‘originary’—is the sixth release in glenmorangie’s private edition collection. it was distilled using floor-malted maris otter winter barley, once ubiquitous in the british brewing industry but now practically a rare breed. oily on the nose, notably linseed, then becoming more floral. cinnamon, ginger snaps, and faint new leather. viscous on the palate, with poached pears, cloves, nutmeg, and polished oak. drying, nutty oak in the finish. £76"
"glenmorangie tarlogan, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,82,"tarlogan is the third and most recent release in glenmorangie’s legends collection. some of the component whisky had been matured in virgin oak casks, while the remainder was aged in bourbon barrels. a hint of freshly-dug soil on the very early nose, then toffee apples, malt, and vanilla kick in. the smooth palate focuses on coconut and more vanilla, with kumquat and lime. almonds and vanilla in the mildly spicy finish. (travel retail exclusive)"
"glenmorangie cadboll, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,115,"part of glenmorangie’s legends collection, this was finished in casks that previously held sweet french white wines. sweet red berries on the somewhat shy nose, with developing low-key honey and vanilla. nicely textured, with a palate of honey, caramel, milk chocolate, shortbread, and lots of lively spice. lengthy in the finish, with more caramel and milk chocolate, plus strawberry and ginger. (travel retail exclusive) £85"
"glenrothes, 1991 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,80,"the newest expression from the 1990s. heavier, richer, and more ripe that the 1987 vintage reviewed above. it is very creamy and mouth-coating, with layers of sweetness (vanilla, caramel, light toffee, white chocolate), fruit (sultana, plum), along with a good underpinning of oak spice. a very nice effort for a whisky this young. 
"
"the glenrothes, 1974 vintage, 29 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,90,"style: speyside single malt scotch color: amber gold aroma: full and creamy. floral, honey, fruit gum drops. palate: rich and mouth-coating. clean. nicely balanced. notes of vanilla, honey, and assorted fruits up front, followed by spicy oak notes, with a dried fruit finish. 
"
"glenrothes, 1985 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,125,"richer, thicker, and more lush than the 1975 vintage reviewed here. fallen orchard fruit, sticky toffee pudding, and nuts, with underlying suggestions of date cake. emerging dried spice and oak resin towards the finish. a good contrast to the 1975 vintage.
"
"adelphi (distilled at glenrothes) 1990 20 year old, 58.6%",Single Malt Scotch,88,124,"the nose is redolent with the smells of autumn jam — slowly stewing dark berry fruits — but there’s a hint of hazelnut adding a drier edge alongside some waxed paper. as it opens, out comes argan oil. this constantly changing array of aromas is very glenrothes, as is the vanilla lift when water is added, which comes with added cordite. the palate is very sweet, filled with fruit syrups and even some dried rose petal. the finish, long. £79"
"glenrothes 1988, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,140,"the hue is deep amber and the nose is equally resonant and rich. this is glenrothes in its most muscular guise, so that while you have the normal layers of fruity complexity, there is an extra weight. think of citrus peels, sticky dates, walnuts, and fruit leather. the palate is soft and rolling with light tannin. for me, it’s at its best au naturel."
"glenrothes elders’ reserve, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,158,"as befits an elder of the church, this has a serious attitude, which with the youngest component being 18 years old isn’t a surprise. full-bodied, but with elegance, not bludgeoning power, this is a refined rothes: malted barley, creamy oak, oxidative depths. sweet with stewed plums and red fruit. the palate is unctuous with little hints of geranium and becomes slightly funky with water, though i’d go neat to get the full effect of bitter orange and sweet honeycomb. (travel retail exclusive.) €99"
"glenrothes manse reserve, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,54,"the youngest of the manse brae triumvirate, and also the freshest. here is rothes at its liveliest, with sweet cereal and the typical spiciness of the distillery undercut by citrus peels, dessert apples, and hot malted milk. on the tongue it is quite delicate, but it is how it behaves mid-palate which is the killer, just stopping and allowing the fruits to liquefy in the center of the tongue. fantastic price as well. (travel retail exclusive.) €40"
"the glenrothes (vintage cask #3) 1998 vintage, 58.3%",Single Malt Scotch,88,110,"lush and fruity. sappy, with waxed fruit, golden raisin, plum, and nectarine rock candy. mouth-clinging finish. definitely post-prandial, after a hearty meal. (with a cigar, perhaps?) (loch & k(e)y retailer exclusive)"
"glenturret fly’s 16 masters edition,  44%",Single Malt Scotch,88,124,"this limited edition 16 year old release is named after a collie dog that belonged to a distillery manager pictured in a 1905 photograph of glenturret staff. malt and milk chocolate, dried apricots, and subtle spice on the floral nose, with a hint of worn leather and, ultimately, ripe pears. supple and rounded on the palate, with sweet spices, honey, black pepper, dark fruit, and coffee notes. finally, bitter orange and plain chocolate in the medium-length finish. (1,740 bottles) £95"
"highland park, cask #1673, 1992 vintage, 13 year old, 57.7%",Single Malt Scotch,88,125,"richly sherried, great mouthfeel, and well-balanced. the sherry is clean, and is only one facet of this multi-dimensional whisky. notes of lush orange and apricot, soaked in molasses and maple syrup. fig cake and oak resin add structure and complexity. dry, spicy cinnamon, resinous finish. (bottled for delilah’s, and for bull and bush) 
"
"scott's selection (distilled at highland park), 1981 vintage, 50.6%",Single Malt Scotch,88,215,"honey, creamy vanilla, caramel, sultana, and toasted almond along with a hint of lemon gum drops and banana. quite floral, too -- lavender, heather -- with a gentle, lingering finish. a very soothing, mouth-coating whisky with excellent balance, while still quite fresh. indeed, a very more-ish whisky -- and sneaky in how it grows on you with each sip."
"ragnvald, 44.6%",Single Malt Scotch,88,539,"pear drops, green apples, lots of toffee, and more spice on the nose than in the sigurd expression; also fresher and fruitier. voluptuous mouthfeel, with sherry, toffee, vanilla, nutmeg, and a wisp of fragrant smoke. toffee remains in the finish, with notes of cocoa powder, smoky oak, and citrus spice. very well balanced.(travel retail exclusive.) €400"
"highland park odin 16 year old, 55.8%",Single Malt Scotch,88,270,"odin is the fourth and final release in highland park’s valhalla collection. it has been aged in a combination of first-fill spanish oak sherry casks and refill hogsheads, with the former predominating. the nose yields cocoa powder, insistent spice, subtle sweet smoke, heather honey, and rum-and-raisin fudge. rich and fruity on the palate, with lively dark spices, plus treacle and peat smoke. the lingering finish initially offers smoky sherry, then dries with licorice and oak. (17,000 bottles)"
"jura prophecy, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,70,"like “superstition,” this is a peated expression of jura. compared to superstition, prophecy seems richer, heavier, sweeter, deeper, leafier, with more tarry notes. i’m also picking up more spice (cinnamon, anise, dark chocolate) and some fruit (lime, mandarin orange, green apple), with a subtle yet intriguing suggestion of burnt popcorn. prophecy is also bottled at 46% and not chill-filtered—which i think brings out more subtle nuances and texture in the whisky. the only tradeoff is that i’m picking up less of the jura spirit and less sea characteristics. but this is a small tradeoff, considering how much more you’re getting with prophecy. promoted as a limited annual release."
"berry’s own selection (distilled at jura) 1976, 55.1%",Single Malt Scotch,88,322,"this expression of jura is by leading london wine and spirits merchant berry bros. & rudd, and was bottled in the company’s berry’s own range at 35 years of age after maturation in sherry hogshead #889. the nose offers sweet sherry and caramel, sultanas, cinnamon, and rum baba, with an elusive wisp of smoke. full-bodied, very fruity on the palate, with mixed spices, pine cones, and old sherry notes. the finish is long, nutty, and luxurious. £200"
"lagavulin, 30 year old, 52.6%",Single Malt Scotch,88,500,"an elder lagavulin. thirty years of oak aging has mellowed this whisky. fragrant and floral, with suggestions of perfumed soap. spicy too, with cinnamon and anise. classic leafy, smoky notes, along with some tarry rope, emerge on the palate and maintain a steady keel as they work their way through an ocean of vanilla malt. lingering finish of burning embers. certainly an enjoyable lagavulin, but i still like the standard 16 year old better. it’s hard to improve on a classic. 
"
"murray mcdavid 'mission' (distilled at lagavulin) 1979, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,180,"straw gold color. peat smoke, damp earth, seaweed, balanced by a maple syrup sweetness on the nose and palate. full-bodied and firm in body. flavors are pleasantly mature and nicely integrated. 
"
"lagavulin distillers edition 1995, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,77,"it’s a brave person who tries to persuade a malt like lagavulin to go into a different direction. indeed, even px casks, from the sweetest fortified wine of all, can’t fully obscure the distillery’s character, just give it a raisined coating. the creosote turns to tar and licorice, while there’s syrah-like sootiness, and damson. this release is slightly less sweet than in the past and is the better for it, though i still prefer my lagavulin relatively ‘naked.’"
"lagavulin 8 year old, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,88,65,"light in color it may be, but this is no wimp. the nose goes straight to the shore with mineral and salt, but it’s also sweet, which allows it to be fresh, lively, yet balanced. the palate delivers some menthol, bay laurel, more brininess, a hint of malt, and parma violet. everything remains very breezy, with peat smoke being blown from a kiln into salt-laden air. i prefer it to the 12 year old and the price is fantastic."
"laphroaig original cask strength, 10 year old, 57.3%",Single Malt Scotch,88,60,"pungent and medicinal in personality, with gobs of peat, tar, iodine, brine, and seaweed. these are all good things.in case you were wondering. a gentle vanilla sweetness tries to tame this savage beast, but it is no match. one of the most challenging-yet rewarding-whiskies in the entire world. what cantillion lambic is to beer, laphroaig original cask strength is to whisky. 
"
"blackadder (distilled at laphroaig), 12 year old, 1988, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,88,60,"pale gold color. bold aromas of sweet wort, seaweed, and peat bonfires. medium bodied and slightly oily in texture. malty sweet flavors up front, followed by peat and seaweed, then taken over by a huge rush of peat smoke that never seems to end. a sweetness stays with the whisky throughout to help balance the peat smoke. 
"
"douglas laing old particular (distilled at laphroaig) 14 year old, 48.4%",Single Malt Scotch,88,142,"big smoke. smoked fish, in fact, with some linked oily elegance, along with touches of hot tar and a cooked agave quality, adding a slightly sour/sweet element; then come poached pear and pepper. the palate is rootier, but always with this deep, clinging texture. as it moves it sweetens briefly, then comes creosote. water gives the sweetness more space before the big phenols come powering back. it’s a barbecue in your mouth. classic laphroaig, in fact. £91"
"blackadder single cask #30013 (distilled at linlithgow) 1975 vintage, 28 year old, 45% abv",Single Malt Scotch,88,135,"also known as st. magdalene, this lowland distillery which closed down for good in 1983 is becoming increasingly more difficult to find. and when one does become available, it will be pushing 20 years old or older, like this one. when young, linlithgow often exhibits a freshness and drinkability, with a gentle maltiness and often hay or grassy notes for complexity. how does this older one fare? quite well, actually. i was concerned that this whisky would have too much oak influence, given how old it is and how delicate the whisky can be. while those years in a hogshead add some dry spicy notes, they are never excessive. instead, they add a complexity that blends in nicely with notes of creamy malt, vanilla, lemon gum drops, grass and hay. i am particularly impressed by the evolution of flavors on the palate and the length and depth of its dry, spicy finish. certainly one of the best linlithgows to come onto the market. 
"
"murray mcdavid mission iv (distilled at linlithgow), 1975 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,210,"one of the better bottlings from this lowland distillery which closed in 1983. velvety and slightly oily in texture, and fragrant. the whisky is balanced, the flavors clean, with no hint of excessive oak. bourbon cask-aging offers up notes of vanilla wafer, along with coconut cream, honey, and a touch of caramel. bright fruit (lemon meringue, pineapple, apricot) keeps the whisky lively, and suggestions of hay and linseed offer continued entertainment. nutty, toasted oak finish. if you are looking for a linlithgow (aka st. magdalene) to purchase before the whisky becomes impossible to find, i can recommend this one. 
"
"cadenhead's, (distilled at littlemill), 1989, 61.6%",Single Malt Scotch,88,115,"white wine color. sweet aromas of confectioner’s sugar, toasted marshmallow, honey, and coconut. its flavors mirror its aroma, with a pleasing creamy, almost buttery, texture and soft, gentle finish. 
"
"loch lomond 12 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,55,"like its elder sibling, loch lomond 12 year old is presented in non-chill filtered form, and in this case, matured in a mix of bourbon, refill, and recharred casks. ripe apricots, vanilla, and a suggestion of peat smoke on the nose.  the full palate offers oranges and pears, plus developing spicy malt and mild peatiness. long in the finish, with spicy fruit notes. drying, with subtle tannins."
"loch lomond, 46%",Single Grain Whisky,88,29,"a rare beast of 100% malted barley mash distilled in a coffey still. dried grasses, butterscotch toffee, honey spread across hot toast, fresh green apples, custard creams, and peppercorns leap from the glass. from the sweet apple, lemon, orange, and honey, it fleshes out with toffee apple, sweet vanilla, and cinnamon stick, concluding with a little more grain character and spice on the finish. delicious stuff!"
"longrow red, 52.1%",Single Malt Scotch,88,79,"this 11 year old bottling of longrow from springbank distillery was matured for seven years in refill bourbon casks before being filled into cabernet sauvignon hogsheads for a final four years. 9,000 bottles are available. the nose offers buttery smoked haddock, coal tar soap, citrus fruit, and new leather, with background notes of soft peat. mouth coating, with rich peat on the palate, plus fruity spice and developing licorice notes. long in the finish, with persistent peat smoke and, finally, red currants. £50"
"scott's selection (distilled at macallan), 30 year old, 1974 vintage, 52.4%",Single Malt Scotch,88,230,"quite fresh and lively for its age and loaded with fruit. you’ll find bright fruit (tangerine, passion fruit, lemon) followed by subtle, sweeter fruit (coconut, honeydew melon, banana, and apple crumb pie). resinous, minty oak notes and a hefty viscosity give the whisky some structure, while floral notes (lavender, rose petals) and gentle vanilla expose a softer side to the whisky. dry, oak finish. 
"
"the macallan fine oak, 30 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,650,"the whisky is quite fruity (green grape, orange, tangerine, and dark cherry), with balancing notes of vanilla, roasted nuts, and a hint of peat. dry, lightly spicy finish that lingers. it is complex and nicely balanced for a whisky of this age. still, i feel the 15 year old fine oak edition is better and, at $65, one-tenth the cost. 
"
"macallan sienna, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,103,"when approached from light to rich, you can see how the driver of the range is oxidation rather than just the addition of wood. here are stewed black cherries, red plums, and blueberries, but with the purity and freshness of amber and gold. the mental image is of a country house in autumn: clay on boots, candle wax, resin, allspice, peels, those perfumed fruits, and the whiff of an artist’s palette. the tannins are supple. best with water on the side. £66"
"macallan coronation cask spanish oak #190952, 55.7%",Single Malt Scotch,88,567,"bottled as 350 ml twin-pack along with the american oak version, this is deeply resinous, with clove, shoe leather, high-grade engine oil—an aston martin workshop, not a back alley garage—alongside dried
fruits. similar in tone to some old caribbean rums with liqueur chocolate and friar’s balsam. the tannins yield slightly, showing chicory and raisin. ‘old style’ macallan, and another which, while strong, is best neat. £350 (one of two 350 ml bottles)"
"macallan classic cut 2017 edition, 58.4%",Single Malt Scotch,88,89,"released exclusively for the u.s., this is the first bottling in an annual series celebrating what macallan terms its “…unrivalled commitment to the mastery of wood and spirit.” matured in oloroso sherry-seasoned american and european oak casks. confident christmas cake aromas, plus quite assertive oak. honey, toffee, vanilla, nutmeg, ginger, and lively oak on the palate. gingery wood notes in the medium-length finish."
"wild scotsman (distilled at mortlach), 1994 vintage, 13 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,65,"this whisky shows the true potential of mortlach -- and at a youthful age, too! quite fragrant and very complex on the nose and palate. chewy toffee with almonds, vanilla fudge, ripe barley, and nougat, with underlying pit fruits, dried spice, and a hint of leather on the finish. very fulfilling."
"old pulteney wk499, 52%",Single Malt Scotch,88,55,"this is the second travel retail-exclusive expression of old pulteney to use the registration of a wick fishing vessel in its name, in this case the isabella fortuna, a herring drifter dating from 1890. this expression bears no age statement and was matured in bourbon casks. floral and fragrant on the nose, with honey, vanilla, zest of lemon, and a hint of salt. the palate features fresh fruit salad, coconut, and sherbet liveliness. summery. medium length in the spicy finish. £35 (1 liter)"
"old pulteney wk217, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,62,"wk217 is the latest in pulteney’s travel retail-exclusive range of releases named after the registrations of fishing vessels. this expression has been matured in a mix of spanish and american oak sherry butts. fig rolls, black treacle, sultanas, and a hint of cinnamon on the nose. finally, milk chocolate. smooth and oily on the palate, with soft spices, before deeper and darker sherry notes arrive. the finish is relatively long, with sherry and spice, then final spiky licorice notes. £40 (liter)"
"old pulteney navigator, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,65,"navigator honors old pulteney’s seafaring heritage and promotional links with matters marine. the expression carries no age statement, is non-chill filtered, and has been matured in a mixture of bourbon and sherry casks. the nose features vanilla, sherry, american cream soda, ginger, orange peel, and cocoa powder. complex. mouth-tingling spices: ginger and nutmeg on the palate, with more oranges, and cocoa. dries slowly, slightly powdery, with persistent citrus fruit, and a hint of brine. value pick."
"old pulteney 1990 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,200,"an unusual vintage bottling of old pulteney, in that maturation occurred in a mix of american bourbon casks and spanish sherry casks that previously held heavily-peated whisky. the nose opens with a whiff of ozone; then lemon, vanilla, and coconut appear, along with fleeting wood smoke. intense tropical fruitiness merges with milk chocolate, lemon sorbet, and lively spices on the palate. spicy milk chocolate with a citric and softly peaty tang in the finish."
"old pulteney 40 year old, 51.3%",Single Malt Scotch,88,2280,"old pulteney’s 40 year old comprises spirit from three sherry hogsheads and one bourbon barrel. just 493 bottles of the distillery’s oldest expression to date have been released, offered at cask strength and not chill filtered. the nose is soft and fragrant, with peaches in syrup, toffee, cinnamon, and aerosol wood polish. early intense orchard fruits on the palate, then nutmeg, cinnamon and black coffee. long in the finish, with spicy oak tannins and seville orange. notably drying."

"royal brackla 16 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,88,135,"as part of its program to make available single malts from all five of its scotch whisky distilleries, bacardi subsidiary john dewar & sons has now released a trio of bottlings from royal brackla, situated near nairn in the scottish highlands. the 12, 16, and 21 year old expressions are initially available in ten markets, including the uk, u.s., and canada.

"springbank, 10 year old, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,88,75,"very powerful and quite different from the 10 year old, 46% bottling reviewed below; this tastes as if it is taken entirely from bourbon oak-aged springbank. there’s fresh brine, creamy vanilla, honey, and coconut throughout, and it lacks the waxed fruit nature of its sibling. mouthcoating in texture, with a long appetizing briny finish. very clean -- and quite polished too, for such a powerful whisky. my choice of the three."
"springbank, 18 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,190,"nice to see stocks distilled after the 1980s ‘silent period’ turning 18 years old. the sherry influence here is complementary, but not overpowering. notes of toffee almond, vanilla fudge, chocolate-coated citrus, bramble, and candied ginger. polished leather, dried spice, and a hint of brine on the finish dries it out nicely and keeps it interesting. not quite as dynamic and complex as some of those legendary pre-1980s springers, but it’s smooth, well-rounded, and more-ish."
"springbank, 18 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,160,"a good dose of sherry here, but there’s plenty of springbank character coming through too! gobs of ripe, red berried fruit (strawberry, rhubarb, red currant, raspberry), especially on the nose, along with raisin. it’s all on a bed of blueberry pancakes, toffee, and fig cake. coconut and brine emerge occasionally on the palate and linger on the finish. a very nice whisky, although i wonder what it would taste like with just a little less sherry influence?"
"springbank 14 year old fino cask (#265), 55.3%",Single Malt Scotch,88,100,"a round of single cask springers matured completely (not finished) in various wine casks for the u.s. market. all four are solid efforts — it’s really a matter of personal preference. a general comment: most of the single cask releases are matured in some sort of wine or rum cask. while this is nice, i would love to see several single cask, cask strength, and fully-matured ex-bourbon barrel bottlings offered for a change. 

the freshest of the bunch, chock full of springbank character. light and lively. floral, with plenty of fruit (green grapes, kiwi, apple tart) on a bed of honeyed malt. nuttiness and brine emerge toward the finish, and linger. "
"springbank rundlets & kilderkins, 49.4%",Single Malt Scotch,88,89,"springbank has released a limited edition of 9,000 bottles of whisky distilled in november 2001, matured in small casks (traditionally known as rundlets or kilderkins), and bottled in january 2012. the small casks have left an impression of accelerated maturity, with coal smoke, cloves, young oak, and caramel on the rich nose. the palate is big and bold, with a sprinkling of salt, then more youthful wood, milk chocolate, and honey, while the finish is long and slightly tarry. £57"
"springbank 12 year old cask strength 2014 release, 52.3%",Single Malt Scotch,88,76,"this is the seventh batch of 12 year old cask strength springbank to appear, being bottled early in 2014. some of the component whisky was matured in oloroso sherry casks. the nose blends maritime notes with christmas cake fruits, vanilla pods, and overt sherry. viscous in the mouth, with cowsheds and soft peat smoke, plus spice, caramel, and a hint of sweet sherry. the no-holds-barred finish presents a big blast of smoke, root ginger, and freshly-dug peat. £45"
"talisker 2003 amoroso finish distillers edition, 45.8%",Single Malt Scotch,88,81,"this expression was distilled in 2003 and after undergoing a period of finishing in amoroso sherry casks it was bottled in 2014. fleeting green apples on the nose, before sweetening with figs, sultanas, red berries, and chili. peat smoke finally makes its presence felt. full-bodied on the palate, with spicy smoke, dark chocolate, peaches, and jaffa orange; the additional fruitiness courtesy of the amoroso cask influence. long and softly smoky in the finish, with ginger and lingering fruit notes. £55"
"tobermory 21 year old, 53.8%",Single Malt Scotch,88,160,"like its ledaig stablemate, this tobermory is offered non-chill filtered at cask strength. finishing occurred in manzanilla sherry casks. orange marmalade, nutmeg, and developing vanilla on the nose. full bodied, with a palate of citrus fruit and soft spices, aniseed, and developing tannins. lingering in the finish, with spicy plain chocolate. ultimately, the tannins fade and leave a fresh citric note."
"tomintoul, 27 year old, 40% abv",Single Malt Scotch,88,175,"very similar in flavor profile to the tomintoul 16, reviewed below, but better. the longer aging has provided extra character and depth. also, on the palate, the caramel flavors are a bit darker (bordering on toffee) and the whisky’s finish is longer and a shade drier. it has aged gracefully, with no excessive woodiness. a whisky that reveals its charm slowly and subtly. 
"
"tomintoul, oloroso sherry cask finish, 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,88,70,"the subtle sherry adds an additional level of complexity when compared to the standard 10 year old, taking tomintoul to a new level. rich and creamy, with well-balanced notes of toffee, vanilla fudge, toasted nuts, and elegant fruit. a surprisingly delicious whisky for 12 years old.
"
"tomatin, 18 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,60,"a new, beefed-up version of the 18 year old, with a higher alcohol level and (seemingly) more sherry influence. i must say that i really enjoyed the previous expression, rating it an 87 for its roundness and elegance. i like this one too, and its bold demeanor. whether you like it or its predecessor comes down to preference and mood. notes of toffee apple, pancakes drizzled with maple syrup, date nut cake, ripe fruit, and roasted nuts, all dusted with cinnamon, vanilla, and cocoa."
"tomatin, 1982 vintage (cask #92), 57%,",Single Malt Scotch,88,553,"aged in a refill sherry puncheon, and the sherry is evident in appearance and on the palate. soft and sweet, with caramel-coated mixed nuts, toffee apple, rhum agricole, currant (red and black), plum, cinnamon, and surprising brisk mint (especially toward the finish). a pleasing, non-aggressive expression of a mature, sherried whisky. (not available in the u.s.)£340"
"tomatin 36 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,780,"tomatin has introduced a permanently-available 36 year old expression, and the first batch comprises 800 bottles. matured in a combination of bourbon and oloroso sherry casks, this expression has not been chill-filtered. milk chocolate and vanilla on the early nose, with background apricots, malt, and ginger. ultimately citrus fruit and sherry. good mouth-feel, lively sweet fruits, cloves, and more ginger on the palate. long in the finish, drying slowly to fruity licorice and plain chocolate."
"duncan taylor dimensions range (distilled at tormore) 2005, 52.1%",Single Malt Scotch,88,78,"is this bottled by duncan taylor or ben & jerry’s? ludicrous amounts of white/milk chocolate and macadamia nut, with green fennel underneath. with water, it opens into dark chocolate chunks (see what i mean?) and cappuccino. one sip makes you worry you’re putting on weight, such is the thickness of its impact. okay, it’s more about the wood rather than the distillery, but you can’t deny that it puts a smile on your face. completely bonkers and somehow wonderful. £49"
wemyss malts ‘honey spice’ (distilled at bunnahabhain) 1991 (bottled 2011),Single Malt Scotch,88,96,"bunnahabhain, along with bowmore, is islay’s greatest user of ex-sherry casks; a throwback to the days when it was part of highland distillers. its rich, thick, and ginger-accented spirit matches the attention of european oak extremely well. in this red tea-colored example, you have resin, saddle soap, ginseng, and treacle toffee on the nose, and a fusillade of roasted spices on the palate before the finish reveals sweet gingerbread. a big huggable bear. £60"
"wemyss malts salted caramels (distilled at glen scotia) 1991, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,145,"just 279 bottles of this 22 year old single cask glen scotia have been released by wemyss malts, with maturation taking place in a bourbon cask. fleetingly, very sweet, crunchy apples on the nose, then caramel, milk chocolate, sherbet dips, plus a hint of brine. the palate is sweet and peppery, with spicy toffee, grapefruit, melon, and walnuts. the finish is medium in length, spicy, with table salt in the tail. £90"
"wemyss malts (distilled at glenrothes) 1988 aromatic orange tobacco, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,188,"highly fragrant and citric, mixing dried and sweet orange peels, moist sultana fruitcake. lightly malty with gentle nuances of fruit syrup. pretty and elegant in the mouth, where there’s orange barley water, mint, and crystallized ginger on top of a thick, honeyed delivery before the classic ‘rothes sweet spices come through. only a drop or two of water is needed. recommended. £117"
"wemyss vintage malt ginger compote, 1996, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,88,84,"the wemyss range — overseen by susan colville — has been quietly building a deserved reputation for being among the most consistently enjoyable single cask bottlings. this new example hails from the mighty benrinnes distillery, but shows a milder side to its make — there is indeed ginger aplenty, along with cumin, crystallized fruit, and jellied peach, but behind is a deep earthy and slightly leathery note typical of ‘the ben.’ it’s these bass notes that dominate on the richly chewy palate. best neat. £51 "
"wemyss malt caribbean crème (distilled at invergordon) 1988, 46%",Single Grain Whisky,88,124,"a divine, lilting nose of exotic summery fruits that brings a smile to your face. split papaya, fleshy mango, and candied peel join freshly squeezed oj and sugar-dusted marshmallows. the thick, syrupy texture fizzes attractively on the palate with flavors of warm marmalade on buttered granary toast. after some mid-palate heat, there is flavored sherbet candy, mint, and burnt orange on the finish. fruity, but happily not sugary sweet like some grains. (171 bottles for europe and asia) £85"
"black bull 21 year old, 50%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,160,"thick orange peels, grapefruit, lime zest, and starburst taffy candies keep the nose of this premium expression within the purview of the black bull character. layers of vanilla custard, mellow fruit, and ginger snaps quench an initial rush of sharp citrus. sponge cake creaminess abounds though the spices nibble at the edges, leaving a long, sweet, citrus finish. water nips the more acidic elements while leaving the citrus flavors intact."
"the whisky exchange elements of islay kh1 (distilled at kilchoman), 59.7%",Single Malt Scotch,88,80,"you’d hardy expect kilchoman to be able to spare casks for independent bottlings, but somehow twe’s sukhinder singh has persuaded anthony wills to part with one of his precious babies. it exhibits classic kilchoman notes of clove and fresh scallop, backed with subtle peat, chamomile, and lint. with water, a typically young, peaty aroma of rubber develops (so drink it neat). it shows the huge potential of this distillery. £50 (500 ml)"
"kilchoman fèis ìle 2016 bottling (distilled 2007), 56.6%",Single Malt Scotch,88,117,"a single oloroso cask bottling, so an interesting comparison with the loch gorm (see below). the cask has more of an influence here, with plummy fruits, fig rolls, and medjool dates. the smoke is restrained and foggy, allowing some seashore breezes to come through. the palate reverses this, with the smoke rolling in first, then the soft dark and sweet fruits, treacle, and garam masala. tannins are very soft. kilchoman with heft. (637 bottles) £90"
"kilchoman red wine cask matured, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,88,125,"distilled in 2012, this was aged in casks sourced from the douro valley in portugal. quite reticent on the early nose, with developing strawberries, vanilla custard, new oak, and subtle smoke. the palate offers smoky red wine notes, with ashy peat, spices, and tingling black pepper becoming more apparent. sweet cherry fruitiness lingers in the relatively long finish with prickly spices."
"glen moray 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,88,40,"matured in bourbon casks, this expression offers a sweet, pleasing nose of honey, icing sugar, toffee bonbons, and orange peel. medium-bodied, with barley sugar, soft oak, nectarine, and lychee. vanilla and a return of honey in the medium-length finish."
"black grouse alpha edition, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,41,"arguably the most successful of the famous grouse extensions (well, the competition includes snow grouse, for pete's sake!), the black grouse brought ever-popular peat into the mix, a move that was followed by a peatier version of johnnie walker black label. the label says this is richer and peatier, and it is. but this scores most for a chicory/coffee and liquid licorice undercarpet that makes it very palatable indeed. neat over ice. (travel retail exclusive)€33"
"kilkerran work in progress 6 bourbon matured, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,60,"as with its sherry wood-matured sibling, this 10 year old release comprises 9,000 bottles and was distilled using the same lightly peated malt and bottled without chill filtration. lemongrass, a pinch of salt, wood smoke, and ginger snaps on the nose. tropical fruits on the soft, slightly oily palate, with a slight underpinning of spicy smoke. nutty, drying, with mellow spice in the finish."
"kilkerran work in progress vii – sherry, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,60,"distilled in 2004, this 11 year old sherry cask-matured expression from glengyle in campbeltown is one of two final releases under the work in progress banner. 6,000 bottles have been released. fragrant wood fires, fruity old leather, damp tweed, sherry, malt, and autumn berries on the nose. the palate is oily, rich, and rounded, with zesty spice, then peaches in syrup and sweet smokiness. the spices persist. the finish is long and warming with chili, licorice, and worn leather."
"kilkerran 12 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,45,"after six ‘work in progress’ releases, kilkerran from glengyle distillery has finally come of age with this core expression. it comprises 70% whisky from first-fill bourbon casks and 30% from sherry casks. floral on the nose, with honey and a hint of brine, then peaty fruit notes develop. the palate is confident and oily, slightly earthy, with tinned peaches, black pepper, cinnamon, smoke, and a suggestion of medicine chests. the finish is relatively long, with pepper, licorice, and drying oak."
"auchroisk 30 year old special release 2012, 54.7%",Single Malt Scotch,88,359,"the original singleton, seemingly discarded as a single malt, rides back defiantly with this bottling. the start shows cherrystone, but there’s an immediate deepening into mature notes of roasted chestnut, varnish, and sweet leather, but always sufficient caramel sweetness to balance. the palate starts sweetly and any grip is dissolved with a drop of water, which also extends what otherwise is a quick fade. old yes, oak yes, but layered and good.  "
"convalmore 32 year old (diageo special releases 2017), 48.2%",Single Malt Scotch,88,"1,400","distilled in 1984, just a few months before the distillery closed, this was aged in refill american oak hogsheads. a whiff of early earthiness gives way to pear drops, honey, vanilla, and resin on the nose. pears, pineapple, caramel, and vanilla on the slightly waxy, spicy palate. slowly drying in the medium-length finish, with peppery licorice and a hint of char. (3,972 bottles)"
"hazelburn rundlets & kilderkins 10 year old 3rd release, 50.1%",Single Malt Scotch,88,101,"this bottling of triple-distilled hazelburn comprises spirit produced in 2003 and matured in unusually small casks known as rundlets and kilderkins. malt, chocolate, and honey figure on the nose, along with a contrasting marine note in the background. unctuous and rich on the palate, with soft fruit, almonds, brittle toffee, and lots of spice. the finish is lengthy and earthy, with caramel and vanilla notes ultimately being superseded by oak and sea salt. £60"
"jewels of scotland (distilled at dailuaine), 1973 vintage, 31 year old, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,88,200,"a robust speysider — and very tactile too (clinging to the palate), but with no excessive oak. vanilla and some dark chocolate notes along with coating (yet ironically dry-ish) honey notes. but its biggest flavor note is citrus — particularly lemon, along with some tangerine and a hint of pineapple — which helps to cut through the thickness. good depth, with dried spice, polished oak, and a wisp of smoke on the finish. (bottled in 2004, but only recently released to the u.s.)"
"dailuaine 16 year old flora & fauna, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,88,65,"these days the mighty mortlach is a known quantity, but diageo’s two other meaty sites—benrinnes and dailuaine—remain in the shadows. this is big, boisterous, and sherried, but there’s less of the gravy-browning elements you get from the other two; at dailuaine it is fruit that is promoted alongside seville orange, treacle, and the inevitable raisin and date. there are nods to px sherry as well. every bit as good as mortlach.  £43"
"ballantine's christmas reserve 2011, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,37,"master blender sandy hyslop has deliberately attempted to capture christmas in the glass, and so it should come as no surprise to find a rich, full, and flavorsome whisky with sherry trifle, red berries, orange fruit, and mince pie filling in the mix. it's put together with grace and style, mixes well, and is that rare beast — a blend that can be enjoyed on its own.  "
"ballantine’s 17 year old signature distillery editions – glenburgie, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,80,"up close, this displays more sherry and dried fruits, particularly raisins, currants, and sultanas, with a deep strawberry note and dollop of marmalade. quite pungent, and that resonates rewardingly at the back of the throat. the juicy mandarin flavor has some tartness, but then there’s cake mix, gingersnaps, clove, and toasted spices, though it gravitates back to the marmalade. the finish has dry, bitter orange, ginger, and spice, with a hint of lime zest. confident and characterful."
"ballantine’s 21 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,139,"baked almond desserts liberally splashed with cream, light caramel, malted milk, and an invading cloud of smoke from newly ignited twigs: a lucky strike from a forest survivalist. on the palate, it is soft and blushing, with marmalade and warm butter, ground ginger, moving to chocolate orange, toffee, and ovaltine. a whirl of spices and chunky chocolate round off this blend’s finish stylishly. this has all the hallmarks of a perfect nightcap."
"the clan denny single grain (distilled at cambus) 35 year old, 54.2%",Grain Scotch Whisky,88,190,"very typical of old grain whiskies: light in body and floral, with soothing vanilla and a mélange of tropical fruit (mandarin in syrup, honey-kissed pineapple, banana, and coconut cream). the better examples, like this one, are not dominated by dry oak on the finish. subtle spices (ginger, cocoa powder) add intrigue. old grain whiskies are hard to find but worth exploring. (a park avenue liquor exclusive.)"
"the sovereign (distilled at cambus) 40 year old 1975, 57.7%",Single Grain Whisky,88,297,"this potent grain whisky from a refill hoggie bears ripe pears, green apples, vanilla sugar, polished horse chestnuts, and a waft of acetone. neat, there is sweet fudge, runny caramels, and heat, but natural dilution dissipates the sweetness to boiled candy with faint cocoa. at this strength, it really takes water generously, illuminating fruitiness and softening the heat. dry, sweet vanilla pricked with orange seals the finish. there’s a sweet spot where this is deliciously drinkable. (114 bottles) £190"
"the clan denny (distilled at strathclyde) 9 year old, 55.7%",Grain Scotch Whisky,88,75,"need more whisky? of course you do! try this then. it was matured in a sherry butt following distillation in 2005: savory, beefy, roasted meat juices, brisket bark, balsamic vinegar, new strips of colored plasticine, and chocolatey guatemalan coffee beans. a sherried, soft, and wispy opener with a whiff of ginger, clove, plum, charred notes, raisins, and black bun: this youngster can handle itself alright. a cloying, clingy finish with heat, sweet sherry notes, and spices. give it plenty!"
"clan denny (distilled at strathclyde) 27 year old 1988, 55%",Single Grain Whisky,88,127,"we get off on the wrong foot with that vegetal note common to certain strathclyde bottlings. it quickly blows over to release candied lemon and orange slices, fresh-baked honey biscuits, eucalyptus, clove, and eventually some fresh breath mints. divinely sweet orange and lemon puddings, caramelized sugars close to burning, and soor plooms. despite the lemon sweetness at the fringes, there remains a central core of mint and clove. sherbet lemons fizz on the tongue to finish. all is forgiven. £88"
"double barrel ledaig/bowmore, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,88,49,"the question with this sort of blended malt is whether the whole outperforms the sum of its parts. this is a big, rich, oily, and peaty whisky, suggesting both the ledaig—the peated version of tobermory and often a bland malt—and the bowmore—capable of big smoke notes when it wants to—are firing on all cylinders. there's not much subtlety to it, but it's enjoyable all the same.€40"
" big peat christmas edition 2017, 54.1%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,88,70,"big peat looks incredibly pale in the glass this year, but his message is undiminished. antiseptic, pine-scented floor cleaner, and an enveloping cloud of peat smoke with underlying peach and faint dabs of lemon. sugary sweet, with lemon lozenges, light vanilla, caramel, and dark toffee, while a bowling, somersaulting smoky element gleefully turns cartwheels in the mouth. hot, dry finish, like gargling with hot coals. merry peatmas everybody."
"william grant’s 25 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,294,"i was surprised to find that grant’s blends were noticeable by their absence in the u.s. but with the purchase of tuthilltown in new york and tullamore dew in ireland, that is slowly changing; and here's proof. beautiful, honeyed, rich, but the 40% abv makes it the whisky equivalent of a radio dj cutting off “freebird” before the solo at the end. still great, and indeed better than most competition, but not the classic it could be."
"house of hazelwood 18 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,65,"the style and class of the youngest was inspired by the classic elegance of paris in the 1920s. comprising kininvie and girvan married in tuns of portuguese oak, this is pure, creamy goodness bathing in lemon meringue pie, vanilla tablet, and fresh oak shavings. a buttery-soft texture, the back of the palate kicks off with honey explosions, nougat, and toffee, backed with a distinct oakiness to remind you that it’s got much more to offer than just vanilla playfulness. £50 travel retail exclusive"
"that boutique-y whisky company (distilled at cragganmore) 26 year old, 50.2%",Single Malt Scotch,88,220,"lemon and lime zest, stewed fruits drizzled in caramel, granola, butterscotch, and refined oak tones on the nose. the meatiness in cragganmore’s new make spirit has long since mellowed in the cask. light orange, vanilla, honey, and those nuggets of hard sherbet that spark up on the tongue. the second phase opens up toffee notes, wood spice, flapjacks, and ends with nougat and orange peel. (batch 2; 130 bottles)"
"that boutique-y whisky company blended whisky #1, 50.3%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,91,"a smashing, rich sherry nose showcases rosehip, elderberry, scorched oak, pipe tobacco, roasted coriander seeds, and damp dunnage warehouses. the core of the flavor is the lush orange jelly hidden in mcvitie’s jaffa cakes, combined with clove, malt, treacle, dried mango, and ginger. water draws out stronger performances from the malty notes, together with some red berry characteristics. let it roll around the mouth, it’s terrific stuff (batch 1, 148 bottles). £57"
"that boutique-y whisky company blended whisky no.1 35 year old, 46.5%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,150,"lighter in character than the 50 year old, batch 4 offers aromas of caramel, artisanal chocolate, red fruits, polished brogues, and a fluttering of asian spices. it has plenty of personality, with molasses, chocolate treacle cake, date, fig, bramble, and black currant, though those spices return, and then it gets rather woody. a sprightly older blend, but beginning to show its age. (1,428 bottles)"
"that boutique-y whisky company (distilled at invergordon) 43 year old, 47.7%",Grain Scotch Whisky,88,108,"like a throwback to childhood: fruity lollipops, love hearts, and gobstoppers. stewed apple, crusty bread, and dry roasted coriander seeds add more dimension to the nose. the palate has toffee, orange peel, dates, and briefly flirts with chocolate and coffee, though this grain has mouth-drawing astringency and savory spices to balance the sweetness. long finish of aniseed, spiced dark toffee, and charred oak."
"te bheag blended whisky, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,40,"pronounced “te veg,” this has its roots in the isle of skye, and as there’s only one distillery there it’s highly likely that the odd
drop of talisker has found its way into the mix. whether it has or not, this is stirring stuff, non-chill filtered so that the flavors burst forth. as you might expect, it’s rugged with brine and chili, giving it a distinctive spice edge. but the delivery is a caramel fudge delight, with luxury chocolate praline in there too."
"douglas laing directors’ cut (distilled at rosebank) 21 year old cask #10146, 53.8%",Single Malt Scotch,88,676,"this example of rosebank was distilled in march 1992, a year before the distillery’s closure, and bottled in december 2013. the cask yielded 141 bottles. the nose is light and mildly floral, with ripe pears, honey, and vanilla. firm and fruity on the surprisingly full palate, with a sprinkling of white pepper, plus summer berries and caramel. tropical fruit, soft spices, and benign oak in the finish, with a final flourish of licorice. £400"
"douglas laing old particular (distilled at miltonduff) 20 year old, 51.5%",Single Malt Scotch,88,113,"pale gold. lightly floral and perfumed. the impression of honey on warm buttered scones. as it opens, so this gentle complexity grows, and gives a sense of some substance. water reveals a hint of malt, fruit syrups, and pear blossom. the palate is creamy and needs a drop of water to reveal the acid/sweet flavor of white currant, and a hint of marzipan. a classic example of a light whisky—and a distillery—which could easily be overlooked. don’t. £74"
"douglas laing rock oyster cask strength, 57.4%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,88,61,"a dense, suffocating fog of peat smoke, sea salt, dry seaweed on the high tide, and lemon-scented candles. remember to come up for air once in a while. a supple, silky texture of lemon mousse, baked apple, vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, and a massive rush of pepper. hold this in your mouth for as long as possible; the flavor delivery is impressively long and constantly evolving. hot, drying finish, and, frankly, a relief from the peppery assault on the palate. £47"

"exclusive malts (distilled at glen moray) 9 year old, 55.7%",Single Malt Scotch,88,85,"distilled in september 2007 and matured in a first-fill bourbon barrel (#5315), this is a fine example of how good a relatively youthful speyside malt can be, given the right cask. soft and fragrant on the nose, with lemongrass, ginger snaps, and light toffee notes. the palate is sweet, with ripe strawberries and spicy fudge. a spicy finish offers cinnamon, milk chocolate, and lingering citrus fruits.

(464 bottles)"
"girvan patent still 25 year old, 42%",Single Grain Whisky,88,422,"william grant is making pioneering efforts to develop girvan as a single grain whisky brand, with more to come. the aromas beckon with masses of buttery vanilla notes, fresh apple, cinnamon stick bundles, dark peel, and chocolate pralines. the creamy, unctuous texture packs in white chocolate, citrus, lime, chewy caramels, and pineapple, with soft american oak characteristics. long finish of vanilla, ground cinnamon, and mint. one of the tastiest grains on the market: expensive, but still, it’s patently very good. £250"

(154 bottles) £90"
"aultmore 25 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,636,"a wild aromatic opening — anise, sweet cicely, even a hint of wormwood — with more oak than the 21 year old, but not in a dominating fashion, rather just a framing device. still fresh and acidic, with touches of a bridal bouquet, freshly baked warm sponge cake, walnut flesh, and, with water, a little bread-and-butter pudding. the acidity gives it a zippy, clean palate zestiness with cumin and angelica. beautifully balanced. £400"
"storm, 43%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,88,40,"treacle tarts, black bun, and polished antique furniture, with fainter accents of dark chocolate, espresso, and delicate smoke flowing freely from the glass. densely structured palate. initially, chocolate-coated coffee beans, then it blossoms into dried fig, date, with a developing deep, tangy chocolate orange note, fading to dusty cocoa like the memory of a warm embrace. not to be confused with cutty sark, this storm is bottled by the whisky shack company."

"berrys’ islay reserve, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,88,63,"gentle peat smoke mixed with smoldering wood shavings, fresh maritime characteristics, and milk chocolate, but leave the glass a while, and when you return, the smoky intensity gets really pumped. light melon flavors become engulfed by smoke, then the pepper, ginger, and chili kick in, leaving the soft fruit and vanilla cowering lamb-like in a corner. if you have peat smoke running in your veins, you will love this."
"duncan taylor 12 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,25,"when in doubt, the answer to any question is usually ‘more whisky.’ here, peat smoke takes an upper hand over the sweet aromas of juicy orange and pear. the whisky begins icing-sugar sweet, settles to bubble gum, pear, apple, and malt, showing its impeccably balanced, finely textured character replete with strands of oak spices, gentle smoke, baked pastry, and vanilla custard. you can’t go wrong at this price."
"jura 10, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,88,55,"this is the first release in the distillery’s new core range for the u.s. after primary maturation in bourbon barrels, the 10 year old whisky undergoes a sherry cask finish. orange marmalade, pine nuts, white pepper, and very subtle smokiness on the nose. the palate majors in overripe jaffa oranges, ginger, and milk chocolate. the milk chocolate darkens in the medium-length finish, with coffee grounds and warming spice."
"moon harbour pier #2 peated edition, 47.1%",Blended Scotch Whisky,88,70,"was the short finish in château la louvière casks from bordeaux’s pessac-léognan appellation sufficient to impact this peaty whisky? a gorgeous color with a nose of sooty, charcoal intensity, hints of chocolate, vanilla pod, clove, and peppercorn. flavors of cherry, rhubarb, orange peel, and plums, speckled with aniseed, pepper, clove, and licorice indicate cask influence. suggestions of menthol and peppermint, before a smoky finish with licorice and bitter chocolate. (20,000 bottles)"
"bruichladdich octomore 7.3, 63%",Single Malt Scotch,88,180,"every month seems to bring a new octomore. much is made of the peatiness of the malt used, but just as important is the way in which it is distilled and matured. it is these two aspects that give it sweetness and balance. this is minty, honey-sweet, with meadowsweet, some dried lavender, tinned peaches, and that hot sand note typical of bruichladdich. the smoke is merely suggestive, giving an integrated power. 5 years old? who knows what might happen next?"

"ancnoc flaughter, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,88,65,"peated to 14.8 ppm, this expression from ancnoc’s peaty collection falls between rutter and cutter in terms of its phenolic level. immediately smoky on the nose, with oily fudge and milky coffee. well-balanced in the mouth, with rich flavors of peat, soft fruit, and vanilla, plus a hint of brine and iodine. the finish is lengthy, with peat embers, walnuts, and more iodine."
"chapter 7 2008 (distilled at allt-a-bhainne) 9 year old, 60.7%",Single Malt Scotch,88,65,"a single cask, cask strength whisky finished in a first-fill bourbon barrel. the initial nose is slightly earthy, with walnuts, juicy fruit gum, vanilla, and ripe peach notes in time. full, sweet fruit notes on the palate, peaches in syrup, overripe pineapple, with milk chocolate, fudge, and nutmeg. the finish is medium in length and perennially spicy, with aniseed notes.

"cardhu 21 year old, 54.2%",Single Malt Scotch,87,267,"there appears to be a concerted effort to bring this distillery out of the shadows: a good thing in my opinion. this limited
release is very cardhu, with masses of mandarin, dried peach, and honey, reminiscent of a fine oxidized chinese phoenix oolong tea, while still retaining the effervescent buzz of youth. akin to a fine cuban rum on the tongue, with bittersweet chocolate, dark cherry, and tangy, spicy life, it dies a little quickly, but is a lovely dram. £160"
"compass box enlightenment, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,80,"this torchbearer for the compass box scotch whisky transparency campaign is looking for your support. a fruit medley of lemon, lime, gooseberry cream, and soft pineapple chunks. ripe apple and pear from the orchard are given a fresh, spicy lift and integrate with the vanilla and sweet toffee notes. it makes a clean exit with lengthy spices and juiciness, never becoming bitter. one thing is clear, it’s a finely structured dram worthy of your vote. (5,922 bottles)"
"compass box the entertainer, 46%",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,135,"this is a special bottling for london department store selfridge's, but it represents a clever strategy by artisan compass box to set its own agenda by regionalizing its whiskies. this is a long way from the new york blend—indeed, creamier and sweeter than other recent releases. it has a honey heart, traces of cinnamon, and menthol in the mix, plus wispy smoke. there's some spice and peat late on, but in relatively subdued form. very pleasant. £85"
"compass box great king street experimental oo-v4, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,48,"great king street was our blend of the year two years ago and compass box wondered where to take it next. so they have released two versions, asking customers to decide between them by voting online. the other one is peated and will probably win easily, which is a shame, because this is a more subtle and better whisky. sherry, syrup, honey, apple, and sultanas are all here, but nuanced. delightful. £30"
"compass box hedonism, 43%",Grain Scotch Whisky,87,62,"gold color. delicate aromas of tropical fruits (coconut, pineapple, mango), marshmallow and vanilla. light in body, with delicate exotic flavors that deliver what the aroma promises. soft, gentle, delicately creamy finish."
"compass box last vatted grain, 46%",Grain Scotch Whisky,87,199,"bottled as london's big ben began to strike midnight on the day that the word 'vatted' was outlawed in scotch whisky terminology, this is a mix of grains from different distilleries and does the campaign for more scotch grain whisky no harm at all.  gossamer soft and smooth with a honeycomb heart and milk chocolate, vanilla, and the odd prod of spice, it's a cushion of a whisky. luxurious, indulgent, and well made. £125 "
"the famous grouse double matured 16 year old vic lee edition, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,99,"just eight whiskies in the blend, married and finished in first fill spanish sherry and bourbon casks. an insistent nose, crackling with spices, with toasted eccles cake anointed with grated nutmeg, vanilla extract, cassia, and dark soy sauce. light honey and vanilla, tangerine oils, and lime peel exhibit perfectly-paced development, with flavor building over a minute or more. warming ginger, spices, and tropical fruits of guava and papaya close out this first annual special edition. impressive work."
"johnnie walker gold, 18 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,65,"an example that older, more expensive isn’t always better, this 18 year old gem is as good as many blends twice its price. the foundation of johnnie walker gold is delicate, clean, and honeyed, along with a fresh sea character (from clynelish?) that provides a youthful zing. notes of vanilla, shortbread, tropical fruit, freshly cut hay, marshmallow, and even a hit of peat, round out the palate. its finish is subtly complex and nicely balanced. the blend has improved nicely over the past several years. 
"
"johnnie walker blenders’ batch wine cask, 40%,",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,30,"blender aimée gibson set out to make a sundowner scotch by incorporating whiskies matured in wine casks. the blueberry, blackcurrant, and fresh oak aromas continue on to the palate: fruit compote, raspberry, strawberry, and lingonberry with light spices. a late resurgence of dark toffee, chocolate, and cigar smoke blow into the finish. sip away by all means, but this fruity sensation calls to be served up in long, cool drinks."
"chivas, 25 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,300,"chivas's new entry into the premium blend category. a complex whisky (on the nose and palate) in the same vein as chivas 18, only deeper, with more caramelized sweetness, darker fruit, and greater emphasis on dried spices and roasted nuts (and perhaps even tobacco). everything moves along nicely -- and entertainingly -- until the whisky approaches the finish on the palate. its age begins to show, as spicy oak dryness and suggestions of polished leather begin to dominate through to the finish. an enjoyable whisky, but i prefer the 18 year old to the 25 year old for its impeccable balance."
"classic cask 23 year old oloroso sherry butt, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,160,"a charmingly sweet nose with christmas cake, swollen raisin, dates, sticky toffee pudding, walnut, nutmeg, and gentle spices confirm the presence of the oloroso cask at work. an oily texture, with butterscotch, tangy peel, and mandarin, becoming darker and nutty, with sultana and plum skin shading into menthol and streaks of bitterness. finally, brazil nut, macadamia, and clove, with a hot, dry, nutty finish.

"cask & thistle (distilled at aberfeldy), 29 year old, 1974 vintage",Single Malt Scotch,87,110,"a prime component in dewar’s blended scotch. the finer bottles of aberfeldy are quite flavorful, yet still maintain a degree of elegance and finesse. this bottling is an excellent example of this. its dominant flavor note is fruit (orange, honeydew melon), with some creamy vanilla notes, caramel, and light toffee. subtle spice notes and a hint of peat tease the palate. the extra aging adds depth to the whisky, yet this whisky remains quite clean and fresh on the palate. subtly spicy, gently dry finish. nicely done!

"that boutique-y whisky company (distilled at aberfeldy) batch 1, 47%",Single Malt Scotch,87,105,"independent releases of the perthshire single malt aberfeldy are relatively rare, and the first batch of that boutique-y whisky company’s no age statement aberfeldy runs to 155 numbered bottles. the nose features coconut ice, vanilla, malt, candied peel, and ginger. good mouthfeel, with more malt, ginger-nut biscuits, icing sugar, and milk chocolate. the finish is drying, with oak and black pepper. £65/500 ml"
"ardbeg dark cove, 46.5%",Single Malt Scotch,87,110,"maybe not as massive as its higher-strength brother (see above), but don’t think that this is light. there’s immediate grumbling peatiness, mixed with dark chocolate, lanolin, and tamarind, while the spiciness brings to mind tandoori food. there’s still the seaweed element, while the lower strength pulls things into a darker core—coal tar soap, damp moss. a very oily palate, that with water takes you onto the peat bog. seashells on a fire and more smoke round things off."
ardmore traditional cask 1998,Single Malt Scotch,87,50,"a single cask of ardmore aged in a first-fill bourbon cask and then finished in quarter casks. this one is more mature, with more depth than the standard ardmore traditional cask (which i rated 80 a few years back). notes of toffee, vanilla bean, chocolate fudge, licorice stick, bourbon, tar, charcoal, and a hint of burnt raisin. very nice!

(released in 2009. sadly not available in the u.s.)£38"
"arran the eagle 1999, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,66,"the latest limited release in the icons of arran series was distilled in 1999 and matured in fourteen ex-bourbon barrels and seven sherry hogsheads. initially launched in the uk, but global availability is anticipated. a sprinkling of coconut, vanilla, and spices, with pears, melons, and pineapple on the nose. full and fruity on the palate, becoming maltier and nuttier. sweet spices, especially stem ginger, and a hint of honey. drying slowly in the very spicy finish (6,000 bottles). £42"

"balvenie 1993 23 year old, 51.9%",Single Malt Scotch,87,"60,000/set","this was aged in a refill american oak hogshead, as was the 1981 expression. like that variant, it has pineapple and lemon on the nose and also yields milk chocolate, green apples, and fresh-sawn wood. smooth, full, and sweet on the palate, again with very ripe tropical fruits, plus apple pie. the finish is medium in length; quite austere."
"signatory (distilled at ben nevis), cask #7438, 31 year old, 1975 vintage, 58.4%",Single Malt Scotch,87,300,"very traditional west highland style: somewhat rustic, muscular, and oily in texture, with notes of leather, bourbon, espresso, orange peel, kiwi, and a suggestion of ultra-aged caribbean rum. occasionally, a softer side of vanilla and coconut shows itself, but, if this whiskey were a man, he would be a lumberjack. 
"
"wild scotsman (distilled at ben nevis), 13 year old, 1992 vintage, cask #693",Single Malt Scotch,87,70,"very robust and chewy-this whisky has plenty of gusto-with notes of toffee, vanilla cream, bitter chocolate, powdered cocoa, and almond fig cake. background citrus (especially on the nose), tobacco, and polished leather. nice depth for such a young whisky, and very exciting. 
"

(exclusive to the party source.) 
"
"benriach 'curiositas,' 10 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,65,"it’s very exciting to see a peated speyside whisky; they are so rare these days. ideally, the peat smoke will add an additional dimension to the whisky without dominating the whisky’s other flavors. most speysiders are big enough to embrace the smoke, as is the case with this expression of benriach. the turfy peat smoke is offset nicely by layers of sweetness (oatcakes, butterscotch, vanilla, and honeyed malt) and soft fruit. dry, smoking ember finish. a steep price for a 10 year old whisky-whisky prices have been climbing faster than real estate lately-but this whisky is worth its price. 
"
"the benriach 20 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,140,"the most richly textured and complex of the unpeated expressions. base notes of honeyed malt and creamy vanilla are complemented by citrus fruit (lemon, tangerine), coconut, bitter chocolate, exotic wood shavings, and a hint of assorted nuts. polished oak finish.

"benriach 10 year old curiositas, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,60,"introduced in 2004, curiositas was the first peated expression to be marketed by benriach. it has been peated to 55ppm and matured in bourbon casks. mildly medicinal earthy peat on the nose, hot road tar, honey, and light tropical fruit aromas. iodine and smoky peat on the palate, with mineral notes, dried fruits, allspice, and oak. more oak in the medium-length finish, with peanut and peppery peat."
"benromach 15 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,100,"the aim with benromach was always to rediscover an older speyside style, and this shows how well owner gordon & macphail has succeeded. there’s a profound sherried introduction, just a little malt, then it is all fruitcakes and light smoke. the palate is properly old-style and oily, with some pleasing zingy orange peel toward the back of the palate. chewy and medium-bodied with good layering."
"benromach sassicaia wood finish 2009, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,87,48,"this vintage benromach has been finished in sassicaia wine casks from the bolgheri wine region of italy after maturation in first-fill bourbon barrels. red currants and warm peat, ginger, and vanilla on the nose. initially, juicy fruit on the palate, but soon drier than expected from the nose. dark berry fruits and subtle smoke develop. relatively long in the finish, with gentle spices. ultimately, sweeter soft fruit notes return. (8,000 bottles)"

"john macdougall's selection (distilled at bladnoch), 16 year old, 55.8%,",Single Malt Scotch,87,120,"bright gold color, and bright in flavor. very much in the bladnoch style, with honey-kissed lemon, tangerine, kiwi, creamy vanilla, lightly toasted marshmallow, marzipan, cut grass, and hay. richly textured for a lowland, and palate-coating (a tad oily, too!). the extra years have added some depth, while still retaining a youthful zest. very enjoyable.
"
"bladnoch adela 15 year old, 46.7%",Single Malt Scotch,87,138,"samsara’s (reviewed winter 2016) younger sibling adela presents an altogether different profile, having been matured in oloroso casks. like samsara, it has not been chill filtered. the nose is nutty, with quite dry sherry notes and prickly spice. finally, fragrant toffee emerges. very supple in the mouth, where the sherry becomes sweeter, along with black currants, licorice, and then black pepper. the finish is medium in length, dry, and peppery."
"bowmore, 1991 vintage, 16 year old, 53.1%",Single Malt Scotch,87,100,"matured in a port pipe. the third in a trilogy (the other two being bourbon and sherry cask-aged). i like this one better than the sherry cask 1990 vintage, but not quite as much as the bourbon cask bottling which was in our top ten whiskies two years ago. lovely amber ruby color. the port flavors are obvious, but not sappy or dominating. they’re clean, and contribute a layered sweetness and ripe red berry fruit notes to the traditional, moderately peated bowmore smoke and peat. lingering smoke and chocolate on the finish. 
"
"signatory (distilled at bowmore), 16 year old, 1988 vintage, cask #42508, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,60,"medium-bodied and nicely textured. good balance of flavors -- and well-integrated, too -- with lovely sweet notes (cereal grain, cookie dough, caramel, and vanilla cream), young heathery peat, tar, fishnets, and brine that is complementary, but not aggressive, with a suggestion of lavender and tangerine. balanced finish. (332 bottles produced.)"
"bowmore devil’s cask batch 2, 56.3%",Single Malt Scotch,87,95,"last year’s was a top-notch, defiantly sherried example of bowmore. this year’s batch thrusts equally boldly, but starts in a more japanese-accented fashion: think soy, miso paste, and salmon teriyaki. light leather, with hickory campfire smoke coming through strongly. the big, oily, tarry palate is like a spent barbecue with a hint of skidding car tires on bowmore high street. so, still a belter, but why so limited? beam suntory, please sort it out! (6,000 bottles) £60"
"bowmore mizunara cask finish, 53.9%",Single Malt Scotch,87,1000,"it’s only right that the first single malt scotch given a period of time (3 years in this case) in japanese oak (mizunara) casks is from beam suntory-owned bowmore. it’s a fascinating mix of the vanilla, spice, and incense notes of mizunara and bowmore’s distillery characteristics. you get rich peat, black pepper, apricot, and peach all playing alongside each other. the palate is clean and lighter than the nose suggests, with a fresh zestiness before the smoke leans back in."
"bruichladdich infinity, 55.5%",Single Malt Scotch,87,80,"aged in a sherry cask, and the sherry is clean and bright. i’m also picking up a good dose of warming peat smoke, along with molasses, and a gentle maltiness throughout. a peppering of subtle brine and a hint of seaweed peak through occasionally, reminding one of its islay roots. 
"
"murray mcdavid (distilled at bruichladdich) 1986, 15 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,80,"bright gold color. fresh, appetizing aroma of vanilla malt, honey, brine, and subtle tropical fruit. light to medium in body and slightly oily in texture. delicious, fresh, subtly complex flavors of vanilla malt, sea salt, subtle tropical fruit, and fresh herbs, finishing dry and lightly spicy.
   style: islay single malt scotch whisky. price: high $70s. available nationwide. 
   since the owners of murray mcdavid also control the bruichladdich distillery, one would expect a good bottling. this is a good one indeed, and very exciting to drink. it is nicely matured, fresh, and deliciously appetizing-almost mouth-watering."
"bruichladdich, pc6, 61.6%",Single Malt Scotch,87,140,"this is six year old, 40 ppm phenol (very smoky) whisky distilled at bruichladdich, bottled at cask strength and enhanced in madeira casks. a young whisky, but mature enough to say that it’s not too young. the immediate impact is damp peat smoke and smoldering charcoal. if you are patient and observant enough (and with an addition of water), you’ll coax notes of vanilla, berried fruit, pear, green apple, and underlying spice (fresh mint, anise), all leading to a briny, smoldering smoke finish. a cult whisky for those who like to push the envelope. when compared to its predecessor, pc5, pc6 is slightly darker in color, creamier, fruitier, and a shade softer. given this, i still prefer the pc5 over the pc6 for its clarity and innocence.
"
"bruichladdich sherry edition, manzanilla, 1998 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,100,"the fresher of the two, with appetizing brine, honey, lemon rock candy, golden raisin, and peach. subtle ginger, toasted marshmallow, and coconut round out the palate. very bright and lively.

"
"duncan taylor (distilled at bunnahabhain) rare auld range 1987 (24 year old), 55.7%",Single Malt Scotch,87,135,"full gold in color, this bunna initially has the lifted moscatel aroma that’s reminiscent of a fine darjeeling leaf tea, then comes melting milk chocolate and touches of sweet cinnamon toast. the palate continues in this sweet vein, but has the distillery’s characteristic thickness in the mid-palate, as well as plenty of its signature fresh ginger note. with water, there are some baked fruits and a hint of flowers. altogether delicious and subtly complex. "
"bunnahabhain 40 year old, 41.7%",Single Malt Scotch,87,3104,"here’s an islay distillery which has never quite had the investment it deserves. hopefully this limited release is the start of an addressing of that situation. it has a classic nose with ginger (crystallized) to the fore alongside toasted almond and the balsamic note that you sometimes get with extra-mature whiskies, manifested here as mulberry vinegar. the mouth has coconut, some grip, and — though it fades a little speedily — retained fire. take with water on the side.  £1,999 "
"gordon & macphail (distilled at caol ila), 8 year old, 1996 vintage, 58.1%",Single Malt Scotch,87,55,"the islay character is most evident in the younger whisky expressions, before the oak has tamed them. this whisky is a perfect example: an uninhibited, incredibly powerful caol ila, thumping out notes of tarry rope, damp peat, kippers, and seaweed. background spices (salt, pepper, ginger) add intrigue, while a firm foundation of vanilla malt struggles to provide soothing comfort. extreme islay whisky. (a binny’s beverage depot exclusive.)

"gordon & macphail “private collection” madeira wood finish (distilled at caol ila), 1998 vintage, 10 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,70,"bright fruit throughout (red raspberry, strawberry-rhubarb pie, gooseberry, red currant, nectarine), honeyed malt, dark chocolate, tarry rope, seaweed soaked in olive brine, and ground pepper. tarry finish. nicely balanced, well-defined flavors, and fully mature at 10 years of age."
"cadenhead’s (distilled at caol ila) 22 year old, 52.2%",Single Malt Scotch,87,156,"with no great wood on show, this is a caol ila which is time—not oak—driven. a very scented, nay herbal start, like bouquet garni with light smoke, grapefruit, sea-washed stones, ozone, and heather blossom. the retention of aromatics is gorgeous. water increases the peat effect but diminishes the aromatics, so take your choice. well worth a look."
"caol ila 2002 feis ile 2014 bottling, 55.5%",Single Malt Scotch,87,167,"restrained, ozonic, with no great smokiness to open, but there is a touch of green grass behind meadow flowers and salt-washed stones so typical of the distillery. with water another marker—drying fishing nets—comes through, with breaths of the sea. subtle and refined. more smoke on the palate, where it’s like a flowering currant bush on fire. great balance of different elements: smoke, fragrance, oil, acidity. with water, real saltiness comes through. very good. £99"
"caol ila unpeated 15 year old (diageo special release 2014), 60.39%",Single Malt Scotch,87,120,"the now-annual unpeated release shows its high strength on the nose, but under the burn is a clean, mineral, and slightly lean caol ila with just a tiny whiff of smoke. a mix of grassiness/herbal notes, with delicate white fruits that plump out into tinned fruit salad, gooseberry, and fresh pineapple. the palate is sweet and cake-like, while the heat enhances its salty tang. delightful, sweet, and long. (10,668 bottles)"
"clynelish, 14 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,45,"it’s good to see an official distillery bottling of clynelish in the u.s. this one is very true to the clynelish style: fresh, appetizing, and very drinkable. notes of brine, fruit (lemon-lime), and vanilla-accented malt, are the foundation of this whisky. delicate seaweed, peat, exotic pepper and a hint of citrus rind bitterness entertain the palate throughout, all the way to its appetizingly briny, seaweed-tinged finish. perhaps the definitive aperitif whisky. 
"
"clynelish 1993, gordon & macphail connoisseurs’ choice range, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,70,"refill sherry hogsheads have been used to mature the latest gordon & macphail bottling of clynelish, the most northerly distillery in diageo’s portfolio. initially quite earthy on the nose, with mustard seeds, pepper, and contrasting malt. becoming progressively sweeter and less complex. quite oily in texture, the earthiness carries over from the nose onto the palate, then sweet fruit notes, malt, and spice emerge, plus a delicate thread of smoke. the finish dries slowly, with a hint of peat."
"the exclusive malts (distilled at clynelish) 1997, 53.5%",Single Malt Scotch,87,100,"this 15 year old bottling of diageo’s sutherland single malt comes courtesy of the creative whisky co., whose exclusive malts range of single cask, cask strength scotch malt whiskies has recently been imported into the u.s. fleeting burnt sugar on the nose, then mango and brittle toffee. vanilla emerges, with slightly smoky malt. finally, cloves. mouth-coating, with lively spices, fruit and nut milk chocolate on the palate. relatively long in the finish, with ginger snaps and a wax-like texture."
"wemyss malts toffee glaze 1997 (distilled at clynelish), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,68,"the latest wemyss single cask release of clynelish from the distillery at brora in sutherland runs to 258 bottles and has been matured in a hogshead. freshly-sliced green apples on the nose, slightly peppery, with grated nutmeg and salted caramels. relatively full-bodied, with lots of soft fruit, principally jaffa oranges, and sweet spice. spicy caramel and cocoa powder in the slowly drying, medium-length finish. £75"
"cragganmore distillers edition, 1992 vintage, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,65,"matured in port casks. the standard cragganmore 12 year old is one of scotland’s best kept secrets-i enjoy its incredibly complex, dry, spicy character. the port contributes ripe fruit flavors (cherries in syrup, golden raisins, mandarin, glazed berries) which complements the dry spicy notes nicely and makes for a more balanced product. still, for this, the whisky sacrifices some of its individuality and brilliancy with all that port. a fair trade-off, though. 
"
"cragganmore 12 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,50,"this oft-overlooked speysider has been frustratingly variable in the past, but now seems to have hit greater consistency. worm tubs and weird stills combine to give a complex malt, but one that needs help from oak to blossom fully. there are hedgerow aromas: black currant leaf, hawthorn berries, and lots of honey. a chestnut note continues on the tongue where, on the finish, a hint of smoke lurks. "
"the dalmore, 18 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,150,"aged in american oak for 14 years and then finished off in spanish sherry butts for several more. a rich, lush, sherried dalmore expression. fruity notes of succulent orange, strawberry rhubarb tart, and sultana, on a bed of toffee and vanilla. a peppering of cinnamon, lemon rock candy, chocolate-covered coffee bean, and lavender adds complexity. perhaps a little heavy-handed with the sherry, but still, it’s a solid effort and a dalmore to enjoy after dinner or as a nightcap. "
"the dalmore tay dram, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,69,"comprising 100 percent whisky matured in oloroso sherry casks, the tay dram is fresh and vibrant on the nose, with fruit and toffee. fuller bodied than the tweed or dee drams, with more overt evidence of sherry, followed through by honey, almonds, coffee, and toffee. dark chocolate is to the fore in the lengthy finish — this time closer to chocolate orange confectionery. £42 currently not available in the u.s."
"the dalmore valour, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,72,"the dalmore has added a new expression to its travel retail portfolio, namely valour. this variant carries no age statement and maturation began in first-fill bourbon casks and 30 year old matusalem oloroso sherry butts before undergoing a finishing period in port pipes. the result is a nose of black currants, caramel, and musty sherry. the palate is medium-sweet, with damsons, jaffa oranges, and printer’s ink. dark berries emerge in time. the finish embraces drying spices, figs, and mildly astringent oak. "
"dalwhinnie, 29 year old, 57.8%",Single Malt Scotch,87,300,"style: highland single malt scotch color: gold aroma: quite fruity (especially apples). hint of honey and caramel with subtle background oak. prickling alcohol before the addition of water. palate: smooth and mouth-coating. nicely balanced. delicately honeyed fruit notes up from, followed by oak and toffee, becoming dry and spicy with pleasant lingering oak. 
"
"dalwhinnie distillers edition 1992, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,81,"equally honeyed; in fact here the finish (oloroso this time) seems to enhance the sweetness. out comes manuka honey, greek yogurt, and heavy blossom notes while the sherry itself brings in a nutty, polished note. there’s just a hint of sulfur when you add water (dalwhinnie is a sulfury new make). the finish is long with some brazil nut. try frozen with dessert."
"dalwhinnie distillers edition 1997, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,85,"distilled in 1997 and bottled in 2014, this expression of dalwhinnie spent a period finishing in oloroso sherry casks. the nose offers honey, ripe oranges, peach blossom, and creamy milk chocolate, with just a wisp of smoke. full-bodied and sweet on the palate, with orange zest, walnuts, more honey, and fruit spices. the finish is long and warming, with a hint of peat and spicy oak."
"blackadder raw cask (distilled at edradour), 1976, 49.4%",Single Malt Scotch,87,135,"gold color. aromas of toffee, nuts, and a hint of mint. medium in body, with a malty, coating texture. the flavors evolve on the palate, with toffee up front, malty sweetness in the middle and nutty, finishing pleasantly dry with a hint of mint and vanilla. 
"
"edradour caledonia, 12 year old, 46%, ",Single Malt Scotch,87,80,"a release chosen by douglas maclean (and named after his song “caledonia”). full sherry impact, but contained—not excessive or sappy. rich, with nutty toffee, pot still rum, a variety of raisins (regular and golden), date, honeyed fruit, polished leather, and a hint of tobacco. good resinous grip on the finish to balance the sweetness. the flavors are nicely integrated. "
"edradour 10 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,50,"edradour, in perthshire, is owned by independent bottler signatory, who has released a wide variety of expressions during the past few years. however, the standard 12 year old remains a classic of its kind.  cider apples, malt, almonds, vanilla, and honey on the nose, along with a hint of smoke and sherry. the palate is creamy and malty, with a persistent nuttiness and quite pronounced sherry, plus a touch of leather. spices and sherry dominate the medium to long finish. "
"glen elgin, 1998 vintage, 61.1%",Single Malt Scotch,87,406,"matured in a “rejuvenated european oak” cask. balance: that’s what i like best about this whisky. it’s not as individualistic or distinctive as the others, but that’s how i always think of glen elgin, so no surprise here. this is a solid effort: fruity and flowery, with notes of tangerine, marmalade, caramel apple, ginger, cut grass, cinnamon, almond paste, and underlying vanilla, lingering in a satisfying finish. (534 bottles) £250"
"glen elgin 12 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,52,"the least well-known of the fogwatt trio which includes longmorn and benriach, it’s unlikely that glen elgin will become a major brand anytime soon, given how important it is to blenders. a combination of long, slow ferments, and distillation coupled with worm tubs gives a ludicrously fruity spirit, which here is bulging with ripe peach, apricot, and galia melon coated in cinnamon and nutmeg, given thick weight by the worm tubs. a classic. £34"
"scott selection (distilled at glen grant) 1973, 26 year old, 58.2%",Single Malt Scotch,87,98,"amber chestnut color. aromas are rich and express great depth, with highlights of ripe fruit and wood spices. well-rounded flavors are balanced very nicely, with a gentle sweetness up front that marries well with ripe fruit, becoming dry with background wood spice notes. 
"
"adelphi (distilled at glen grant) 1985 25 year old, 55%",Single Malt Scotch,87,138,"old gold in color. obviously an old whisky, but a delicate one that has subtle complexities; the balance between the dried grass/hayloft, the dried orange peel, and stewed apple, for example. sweet and fragrant, it shows chypre notes with water alongside a more gentle floral aspect. the palate is drier than the nose suggests, quite mineral, with a lacy character. the finish shows melon and mint. glen grant in gentle repose.£88"
"glen grant 50 year old, 54.4%",Single Malt Scotch,87,14999,"deep ruby with a yellow rim. clearly mature, and heavily sherried. a highly concentrated nose: marmite and soy sauce, and all the fresh fruits of youth reduced to essence. drinkwise, it’s closest to chinato: curative barks, dried herbs (mint, hyssop, oregano). the palate is unsurprisingly thick and lightly smoky, but the tannins aren't overly astringent, and there remains a sweet core still, even if the overall effect is dark. it’s not obviously glen grant, but it is a fascinating glass."
"signatory (distilled at glen ord), 1998 vintage, 11 year old, cask #3465, 60.3%",Single Malt Scotch,87,110,"bright gold color. big and firm on the palate. quite fruity too (tangerine, pear, sultana, pineapple), on a dry malty foundation. lighter notes of grass, hay, linseed oil, and dried vanilla add complexity. dried fruit and malt finish. a really nice dram with gobs of character."
"duncan taylor nc2 (distilled at glen scotia), 1981 vintage, 18 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,114,"glen scotia has always been the bridesmaid to springbank. this is justifiable, considering that both production and availability of quality bottlings have been sporadic over the past decade or so. i like this one. it really shows the simple, coastal pleasantness of this campbeltown distillery. ripe malty notes are accompanied by brine, cut hay, banana cream pie, and honeyed vanilla. lingering salty, malty finish. with all the sherried and wine-finished springbanks recently on the market (not that there’s anything wrong with that), here’s a nice, no-frills, campbeltown whisky. "
"glen scotia 16 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,88,"the nose gives a whiff of vanilla fudge, then black pepper, sea salt, and a savory note develops. the palate yields maritime-tinged candied fruits and effervescent smoke. slightly tarry in the finish. macho!"
"douglas laing old particular 21 year old (distilled at glen scotia), 51.5%",Single Malt Scotch,87,137,"whiskies in douglas laing’s new old particular range are non-chill filtered and bottled at three strengths, with those aged 19 years and over being offered at 51.5%. this glen scotia was distilled in may 1992 and boasts a nose of violets, musky malt, soft smoke, and a fresh sea breeze. big, spicy, and quite oily on the palate, with dark berries, black tea, and a note of tar. long and dark in the finish, with oak tannins and persistent licorice. £85"
"glen scotia victoriana, 51.5%",Single Malt Scotch,87,115,"the most expensive of glen scotia’s new trio has been finished in deeply-charred barrels and bottled non-chill filtered at cask strength. soft and sweet on the nose, with peaches, fudge, and a hint of oak. full-bodied and slightly oily on the palate, with wood spices, vanilla, and blackberries. smoky ginger and lively char in the lengthy finish."
"murray mcdavid mission iv (distilled at glen spey), 1974 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,210,"although this distillery is operating, it remains one of the hardest speyside whiskies to find. this is unfortunate. a fairly straight-forward whisky-pleasingly malty and somewhat viscous on the palate, with some grassy notes. the extra years, with this particular bottling anyway, have allowed the whisky to blossom, become a little more intriguing and heavier. along with malt and grassy notes, i’m picking up citrus fruit (especially on the nose), toffee, nuts, freshly ground roasted cocoa beans, nougat, and vanilla fudge. 
"
"glencadam 30 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,451,"this is a single cask (#729) bottling, distilled in 1982, and the outturn was just 260 bottles. soft and supple on the waxy nose, with worn leather, jaffa oranges, and malt. lots of leather, with brittle toffee, orange creams, and a slightly musty note on the full palate. mouth-drying in the lengthy finish, but the tannins never come close to overwhelming. £280"
"glendronach, 12 year old, 40% abv",Single Malt Scotch,87,48,"over the past decade there has been no shortage of glendronach expressions. i know of at least one 15 year old, an 18 year old, a 19 year old, a 1968 vintage, and four different 12 year old versions. my favorite of the range was the limited edition 19 year old released here in the u.s. about a decade ago. the 1968 vintage, which you can still find on retailers’ shelves, is also a worthy dram. but this new 12 year old “original” expression is certainly my favorite of the 12s (and the 15). i feel that glendronach expresses itself best when it is not dominated by the sherry, allowing a greater balance of flavors. this whisky was originally matured in sherry casks, but was then (fortunately) aged in bourbon casks for the remainder of its maturation. the result? a richly flavored, nicely balanced whisky expressing notes of sherried fruit, burnt caramel, light toffee, and nuts, all underpinned by a soothing malty foundation. yum! 
"
"glendronach sauternes finish, 46%, 14 year old",Single Malt Scotch,87,75,"the rich, sweet sauternes dessert wine adds its signature. quite lush, with golden raisin, crème brûlée, rhubarb pie, honey-kissed citrus, and creamy vanilla. a lovely example of a dessert whisky — comforting, warming, and embracing. (i would also enjoy this after a brunch of crepes, fresh fruit, and maple syrup.) "
" glendronach cask strength (batch 5), 55.3%",Single Malt Scotch,87,72,"this batch of glendronach’s popular cask strength has been aged in a combination of oloroso and pedro ximenez sherry casks. malt, honey, rose blossom, and chocolate-coated turkish delight, plus emerging vanilla on the nose. the palate is full and rounded, very sweet, with more milk chocolate and very gentle spice. the finish is lengthy, with milky coffee, sweet spices, and subtle oak."
"glenfarclas family cask 1981 (cask 57), 50.8%",Single Malt Scotch,87,386,"this is a refill (or in 'farclas terms, ‘plain’) hogshead, so there is less wood on show and more distillery. the nose is like a gentleman’s club at lunchtime: roasting meat, some pipe tobacco, polished wood, and the scent of a freshly-dug garden wafting through the windows. the palate shows slightly more fresh fruitiness (in line with the 1971 cask). there’s decent grip; think treacle this time. fluxes and changes, which makes it all the more intriguing. £246"
"glenfarclas family cask 1984 (cask 6030), 51%",Single Malt Scotch,87,392,"a refill hogshead this time, which when combined with its (relative) youth throws the distillery character into even greater focus. positively light to start with, a green edge to the dry grass seen in the 1970s and more of the fruity notes hinted at in the 1982. all the time, though, it is anchored by meaty earthiness and that distinctive burnt note. the finish is a little short, but all in all a very appetizing example. £250 "
"glenfarclas family casks 1969 cask #2545, 57.5%",Single Malt Scotch,87,1456,"this comes from a refill butt and has a light, paler color. the lack of huge oak interaction has given an amazing freshness; think of freshly-applied plaster, syrup, hot green bracken, a touch of nuttiness. it takes water well, allowing pure, soft fruits to come through, and it is these which become almost syrup-like in the mouth, while never losing glenfarclas’ central depth and roasty richness in the center. £865"
"glenfiddich over 38 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,4664,"surprisingly pale (you see the issue, macallan?), but long aging in refill casks helps eliminate the bluntness of oak and can produce aromas that have been reduced and then taken into an exotic realm; here manifested as quince paste and kumquat followed by crystallized and candied fruits. the palate is subtle and soft with light heat, toasted chocolate, white currant, and then overwhelming cherry blossom. exotic is the word. bottled for china, but may be given a wider release. £3,000"
"glenfiddich vintage cask, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,111,"one of a trio of new whiskies that have spent time in glenfiddich’s new solera vats, this will surprise many because of its overt smokiness that’s like a bonfire in a pear orchard. some ferny greenness adds to the freshness. the reverse happens on the palate, with the smoke being held in check by the soft mouthfeel (which could be solera-enhanced), ripe fruits, and gentle creaminess. (travel retail; asia only, currently.)£70"
"glenfiddich project xx, 47%",Single Malt Scotch,87,62,"one of two initial releases in glenfiddich’s experimental series, this is a non-chill filtered expression. a vatting of twenty casks, including first-fill bourbon, sherry butts, and port pipes. the nose is fragrant and faintly oriental, with vanilla, jaffa oranges, and apricots. the palate is full and sweet, with oranges and lemons, fudge, plump sultanas, milk chocolate, and tangy spices. drying steadily to fruity oakiness in the relatively lengthy finish. £50"

"glen garioch 15 year old the renaissance chapter one, 51.9%",Single Malt Scotch,87,108,"the first of four ‘chapters’ under the renaissance banner, all of which will consist of spirit made since glen garioch reopened in 1997. this 15 year old release has been matured in sherry and bourbon casks, and 12,000 bottles are available. ginger features on the early, perfumed nose, with soft toffee, oranges, and dates. milk chocolate on the creamy palate, where the ginger theme continues, along with cinnamon and caramel. the finish offers rich chocolate and orange, which finally fades. £75"
"glenglassaugh aged over 30 years, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,637,"this malt is actually 36 years old, having spent its first 34 years in a refill hogshead before two years of maturation in a first fill ex-sauternes cask. the out-turn was 280 bottles. mellow on the nose, with fresh oranges and apples, developing toffee, and violets. smooth and fruity on the palate, with dark chocolate, pepper, and discreet tannins. long in the finish, with fruity oak. £400"
"glengoyne, 21 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,80,"while younger glengoyne whiskies are enjoyable but often fairly straight-forward in flavor, the older expressions develop nicely in depth. regardless of age, there’s always a creamy maltiness as the foundation of the whisky. for this expression, notes of honey, cookie dough, dry spice notes (vanilla, cinnamon) and soft fruit (citrus, apple) round out the palate. this whisky is clean, polished, and very drinkable. a new addition to the glengoyne line, and very welcome. 
"
"the glenlivet cellar collection, 1967, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,200,"deep gold color. a very delightful aroma that defies its age, with notes of rich creamy vanilla, exotic tropical fruit, honey, and toasted oak. rich, mouth coating texture and body. its flavor starts out like its aroma-creamy vanilla, tropical fruit, honey-then turns dry and becomes very dry, leathery, and oaky on the finish. soothing, long dry finish. 
"
"the glenlivet french oak reserve 15 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,50,"i enjoy glenlivet whisky for its subtle elegance, floral notes, along with a delicious ""peaches & cream"" flavor. for this particular whisky, finishing some of the whisky in new french oak barrels adds depth, dried spice (vanilla, clove) and pleasing dryness to the glenlivet profile. this whisky is more polished and refined than the 12 year old expression it replaces. 
"
"glenmorangie, 1977 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,200,"style: highland single malt scotch color: gold aroma: subtly complex and somewhat dry, with notes of vanilla, almonds, hay, freshly cut grass, and a hint of smoke. palate: clean and malty up front, becoming dry as it begins to reveal its age, as the maltiness turns into a potpourri of spice and dried fruit. dry on the finish and spicy-almost peppery. its finish is big and long for a glenmorangie whisky. 
"
"glenmorangie quinta ruban, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,70,"finished in port casks. like the nectar d’or above, this expression adds lushness, body, and a sweet complexity (but with darker fruit and spice than the nectar d’or) while still allowing glenmorangie’s complexity to shine through.

"
"glenrothes, 1994 vintage, $43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,78,"very bright and lively, with a nice balance of flavors. zesty fruit (lemon, peach, ripe pineapple, golden raisin) on a bed of layered sweetness (creamy vanilla, light honey, lightly toasted marshmallow, and a hint of coconut). gently dry, delicately spicy, dried citrus finish. light enough and with enough zing to enjoy before dinner, but it should stand up well enough after dinner, too. this is a nice whisky, but it shows a lighter, more elegant side of glenrothes. it doesn’t express the rich, opulent notes often shown in bottlings like the 1972 vintage, for example."
"glenrothes 1978, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,322,"though this has been on the shelves in the uk for a while, its u.s. release has been delayed. it shows a classic mature ‘rothes nose, mixing moist fruitcake, vanilla, and a tickle of maltiness. what sets this apart is the weight of the stewed fruit and a dry note reminiscent of light rain on tweed. the palate is typically slow with a sparky spiciness and a lick of hazelnut butter to caress your throat. worth the wait. "
"glenrothes vintage reserve, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,60,"a new nas, this has a thick, silky nose in classic ‘rothes style which reminds you of coffee cream icing, hazelnut syrup, semi-dried soft fruits, and horchata. the palate has elegance and poise, with a hint of menthol lifting off into pecan and light grippy oak. has excellent length and mellow flow. water slightly reduces its voluptuous charms, so be careful (or simply avoid). praise for revealing all the vintages used, and the fantastic price. chapeau! £39"
"chieftain’s (distilled at glenturret) 21 year old, 55.8%",Single Malt Scotch,87,140,"a comparatively rare independent bottling of what is, in any case, a hard to find single malt. distilled in 1990, matured in an american oak hogshead (#646), and bottled at cask strength. white pepper, damp earth, violets, cinnamon, and slight saltiness on the nose. the pepper blackens on the idiosyncratic palate, with cough syrup, big spice notes, and dark berries. long and peppery in the finish, with developing oak tannins."

"
"highland park, cask #10146, 1990 vintage, 15 year old, 53.6%",Single Malt Scotch,87,78,"the darkest and most decadent of the three 15 year olds here. notes of molasses, demerara rum, apricot, and dates. more subtle notes of mixed nuts, sap, tobacco, and fig, with just a hint of moroccan spice and leather. surprisingly complex for a whisky this young, and the most intriguing of the younger expressions reviewed here.

"highland park ice edition, 53.9%",Single Malt Scotch,87,270,"ice edition is a 17 year old matured predominantly in bourbon casks. just 30,000 rather extravagantly presented bottles are available globally.  fresh and fruity on the nose with light trademark highland park sweet smoke, ginger, and a hint of dry earth. in time the fruits become more clearly defined as pears and peaches. full and viscous on the palate; vanilla, pepper, brief orchard fruits, then dry peat, licorice, aniseed, and a lingering, relatively dry finish."
"highland park valkyrie, 45.9%",Single Malt Scotch,87,71,"valkyrie replaces the current dark origins expression and was matured in a combination of first-fill american oak sherry casks, american oak bourbon casks, and european oak sherry casks, along with some refill casks. apricots and aromatic wood smoke on the nose; slightly oily, with raisins. stewed fruits on the palate, with earthy peat, licorice, and black pepper. aniseed, dark berry notes, and wood spice in the finish."
"highland park magnus, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,40,"named for highland park distillery’s founder, magnus eunson. it has been matured in first-fill and refill american oak sherry casks. the nose offers honeysuckle, vanilla, rising bread dough, and faint, aromatic wood smoke. slightly smoky orchard fruits on the early palate, with sultanas, ripe cherries, and cinnamon. medium to long in the finish, with drying fruit notes, wood spice, and ultimately, licorice sticks.

"highland park full volume, 47.2%",Single Malt Scotch,87,100,"full volume is a u.s.-exclusive bottling that was distilled in 1999 and matured entirely in first-fill bourbon casks. the nose is fragrant, with canned pears and vanilla ice cream, coconut, and a very subtle wisp of smoke. quite thin on the palate, nutty, mildly herbal, with tropical fruits. ashy peat smoke, cocoa powder, and wood spice in the medium-length finish."
"laphroaig, 40 year old, 42.4%",Single Malt Scotch,87,500,"amber copper color. very mature aroma of oak, damp earth, peat smoke, licorice, soft citrus, and seaweed. full-bodied and somewhat oily. a gently sweet vanilla note up front-albeit very briefly-then a quick flash of citrus fruit and seaweed. after that it's a battle between peat smoke and oak, with the oak ultimately winning. very long, dry, smoky finish."
"linkwood, 1996 vintage, 58.2%",Single Malt Scotch,87,325,"matured in a sherry cask. chock full of ripe fruit, but still quite feminine in personality. firm malt foundation, almost buttery in texture, with juicy oak, maple syrup, raspberry (red and black), strawberry, and dates, peppered with gentle spice (cinnamon, ginger). while this is a very enjoyable whisky, i have tasted some excellent linkwood bottlings, including the standard 12 year old from back in the early 1990s, that brandished less sherry, allowing more of linkwood’s gentle nature to blossom. still, the sherry influence here is pristine, and it gives as much as it masks. (430 bottles)£200"
"the whisky exchange (distilled at linkwood) 16 year old, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,87,108,"the combination of linkwood and sherry cask can be to the detriment of such a perfumed whisky. not here. the nose speaks of caramel toffee, demerara sugar, and while an oaky touch is there it’s light, allowing plump sultanas, rose, and a delightful balsamic cider vinegar note to emerge. the palate is relaxed and gentle, with darker fruits. there’s sufficient body to cope with the tannic squeeze. it needs water to reach ideal balance. lovely. £65"
"longrow red 11 year old port cask, 51.8%",Single Malt Scotch,87,82,"the latest incarnation of springbank’s longrow red matured for 11 years in port casks before being bottled at cask strength. the nose is sweet, with cherries, caramel, new leather, chewing tobacco, and soft peat. voluptuous in the mouth, with a palate of rich peat, summer berries, and toffee apples, with growing spice notes, and light oak. lengthy in the finish, with cinnamon, peat, sweet oak, and red berries."
"single malts of scotland (distilled at longmorn) 1992, 49.7%",Single Malt Scotch,87,135,"longmorn always has this fruitcake thing going on and this is no exception. a sherry hoggie  helped provide sultana, cake mix, grilled almond, rhubarb puree, and a little cigar box. the palate is very fruity, with light darjeeling-like tannins, then red fruits. it becomes nuttier as it moves and needs water to add ripeness to the stone fruit base. highly recommended and extremely well priced. £80"
"the macallan, 1951 vintage, 48.8%",Single Malt Scotch,87,2000,"amber mahogany color. its 50 years of age are evident in the nose-there's plenty of resinous wood spice notes (especially clove). also on the nose is citrus (especially orange), a potpourri of dried fruit, light toffee, and a hint of smoked nuts. the body is thick and viscous. the palate expresses flavors similar to its aroma, finishing dry and long."
"macallan diamond jubilee, 52%",Single Malt Scotch,87,549,"a vatting of sherry casks from (apparently) royally significant dates with an outturn of 2012 (get it?) bottles. auburn in color, it has a fruit compote nose mixed with citrus, and a little hint of gravy browning in the background. this mix of the exotic—oil of clove on the tongue, the sweet and light grip—makes for a very intriguing, concentrated, and layered palate. think of turkish delight and crystallized ginger. try the distillery shop for stock. £350"
"macallan edition no. 1, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,87,90,"people tend to moan about macallan having lost its mojo. not here. this is a vatting of different sized american and (mostly) european oak casks, so no surprise that it’s oak-led, but macallan is a heavy distillate and it needs oak to prosper fully. here you get rosin, marmalade, green fig jam, and the power of concentrated oils. the palate is powerful and supple, with some clove, ginger, and yet more chocolate. substantial and well worth checking out."
"mannochmore 25 year old, 53.4%",Single Malt Scotch,87,400,"along with auchroisk, mannochmore is one of diageo’s well-kept secrets. this 1990 distillate was matured in first-fill american oak hogsheads and european oak butts. oily orange notes on the nose, plus vanilla, brittle toffee, and honey. the palate is substantial, rich, and sweet, with figs, sultanas, banana, and more honey, plus developing cloves. raisins and plain chocolate in the long, spicy finish. diageo special releases 2016 bottling.

"
"old pulteney, 17 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,80,"pleasingly sweet and fruity, with notes of caramel apples, berries in honey, vanilla, and ripe pear. fresh brine and subtle mint emerge occasionally and linger on the finish. nicely balanced, more complex with a wider range of flavors than the old pulteney 21 year old. "
"old pulteney 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,35,"scotland’s northernmost mainland distillery, located in the historic port of wick, is owned by inver house. the ‘entry level’ 12 year old expression is widely available. the nose presents pleasingly fresh malt and floral notes, with a touch of pine. the palate offers a fuller bodied, sweeter whisky than the nose might lead one to expect, with more malt, spices, fresh fruit, and a suggestion of salt. the finish is medium in length, drying, and decidedly nutty."
"gordon & macphail (distilled at pulteney) 21 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,120,"gordon & macphail bottled a 21 year old expression from scotland’s northernmost mainland distillery for the u.s. market earlier this year. sweet on the nose, with honey and vanilla; fleetingly, stewed apricots and peaches, plus a hint of caramel. intensely focused, sweet tropical fruits on the palate, with barley sugar. becoming nuttier, with an edge of mixed spices. spice fading to milk chocolate in the medium-length finish, with just a suggestion of brine. "
"pentland skerries, 46%,",Single Malt Scotch,87,92,"maturation of the pentland skerries bottling of the lighthouse collection has taken place exclusively in former spanish sherry casks, which lends the nose rich, dark sherry and christmas cake notes, caramel and old leather, along with the distillery’s characteristic saltiness, which here comes across as salted peanuts. full-bodied and slick in the mouth, overt sherry, sultanas, figs, spice, and contrasting brine. mild maritime notes and autumn fruits combine with prunes and sherry in an accomplished, after-dinner finish. £55/liter"
"port ellen 34 year old, 55%",Single Malt Scotch,87,2000,"here’s a classical port ellen, where the intense, even monomaniacal delivery of smoke mixes with damp face flannel, purple smoke, green ferns, and rapeseed oil. lots of minerality, to the point of being almost flintily uncompromising. water makes it more naked. the palate is excellent, with an explosion of preserved lemon-accented smokiness, touches of spanish paprika, a sweet syrupy center, before a massive licorice finish. peatiness for the purist, but whenever was that different? (2,958 bottles)."
"signatory (distilled at rosebank), 14 year old, 1991 vintage, cask #4755, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,60,"delicately floral (lavender, rose) and perfumed, with notes of chamomile, hay, soft vanilla and gentle malt. creamy and soothing, with a gently dry finish. lots of depth for a lighter weight whisky. a lovely aperitif. i feel rosebank is freshest and best when it is young. with the distillery closing in 1993, now’s the time to act, and this is one of the better bottlings i’ve tasted. 
"
"royal brackla 21 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,270,"as part of its program to make available single malts from all five of its scotch whisky distilleries, bacardi subsidiary john dewar & sons has now released a trio of bottlings from royal brackla, situated near nairn in the scottish highlands. the 12, 16, and 21 year old expressions are initially available in ten markets, including the uk, u.s., and canada.
more restrained on the nose than the 12 and 16 year old variants, with green apples, melons, and damp grass. the palate is silky and refined, with fresh fruits, just a hint of sherry, light spice, and a wisp of smoke. aniseed and drying old oak in the earthy, lengthy finish."
"scapa glansa, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,72,"glansa is described as a “peated whisky cask finish,” with the majority of its unspecified maturation time being spent in first-fill american oak casks. madeira notes on the nose, with vanilla, honey, and pears. richly fruity on the palate, with cocoa powder, vanilla, caramel, and mild wood smoke. dark berries emerge from the background. the dark fruits continue through the lengthy finish, where smokiness increases."
"springbank, 40 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,950,"antique gold color. mature aromas of creamy vanilla, thick coconut, oak, and a hint of mint. the classic springbank sea breeze aroma struggles for recognition. medium body and oily in texture. flavors deliver what the aroma promises, with additional dry wood spices and a very long finish. 
"
"springbank 14 year old amontillado cask (#305), 55.4%",Single Malt Scotch,87,100,"a round of single cask springers matured completely (not finished) in various wine casks for the u.s. market. all four are solid efforts — it’s really a matter of personal preference. a general comment: most of the single cask releases are matured in some sort of wine or rum cask. while this is nice, i would love to see several single cask, cask strength, and fully-matured ex-bourbon barrel bottlings offered for a change. 

citrus, exotic wood, and botanicals on the nose and palate. indeed, there’s a bit of intrigue here. nice balance, with roasted nuts, pecan pie, and more exotic wood on the finish. "
"springbank calvados wood 12 year old, 52.7%",Single Malt Scotch,87,105,"this expression from the campbeltown distillery of springbank was distilled in april 2000, matured for six years in refill bourbon barrels, and then for another six years in calvados casks. the outturn was 9,420 bottles. toffee apples dipped in soft spices on the nose, with a follow through of vanilla. quite viscous on the palate, with white wine, red peppers, and cinnamon, along with a tang of peat. lime marmalade and a touch more peat in the relatively dry finish.

"talisker 30 year old, 45.8%",Single Malt Scotch,87,471,"as part of a rebranding of the entire talisker range, diageo has brought its special releases 25 and 30 year old cask strength expressions into the full-time fold, reduced in strength to 45.8%. sweet and buttery on the nose; soft fruits and fragrant malt, milk chocolate, and dry, crumbling peat. citrus fruits (notably lemon), licorice sticks, black pepper, and scorched wood on the palate. dry and oaky in the lengthy finish, with peat notes and allspice to the end. £300 "
"talisker triple matured edition, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,87,135,"this no age statement talisker is one of the first “triple matured” (so-named) whiskies exclusive to friends of the classic malts. successive periods of aging occurred in refill casks, charred american oak hogsheads, and european oak refill casks. ozone, fresh asphalt, dried fruits, and old leather on the nose. a big pepper hit in the mouth, backed by earthy peat, elastoplast, vanilla, and citrus fruits. the pepper lasts right to the end in the long, steadily-drying, charcoal-fueled finish. £80"

(travel retail exclusive)"
"duncan taylor (distilled at tamnavulin), 37 year old, 1967 vintage, 46.7%",Single Malt Scotch,87,240,"deep amber/chestnut/crimson color, suggesting a good dose of sherry cask aging, which the palate confirms. syrupy notes of fruitcake, burnt fig, raisin, and beeswax are balanced by resinous oak, polished leather, roasted nuts, and dried spice on the finish. the 37 years of oak impact is balanced nicely by the sherry, even if both are a bit extreme for what is normally a more elegant dram. 
"
"tobermory, 10 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,36,"straw gold. aromas of a sweet shop-vanilla, honey, marshmallow, and confectioner’s sugar. light to medium body, and soft. clean flavors, which are very malty and honeyed, with notes of marshmallow and vanilla. gently sweet finish. 
"
"tomatin, 18 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,60,"fuller in body, deeper and more complex than the 12 year old (as would be expected). sweeter fruits (honey-laced citrus, lemon gum drops, and ripe peach) and rum notes marry nicely with dried spice (cinnamon, vanilla, ginger). calming finish. an intelligent use of sherry cask aging. 
"
"tomatin, 30 year old, 1976 vintage, 49.3%",Single Malt Scotch,87,400,"bold and spicy, but with enough backbone to handle it. surely the most intense of the bunch overall. (the 25 year old is dry on the palate -- especially on the finish -- but the 30 year old challenges you the throughout.) there’s plenty of oak here, imparting leather, resin, and dried spice notes (cinnamon, clove, vanilla), but it is rescued by sherried fruit, honeyed citrus, and toffee. a powerful dram."
"douglas laing director’s cut (distilled at tomatin) 45 year old, 51.6%",Single Malt Scotch,87,353,"this veteran example of tomatin was distilled in november 1967 and matured for 45 years in refill butt #9315. the outturn was
175 bottles. uncompromising dark sherry and treacle notes on the fruity nose, along with gunpowder tea. big, old sherry notes on the full palate, with raisins, sultanas, and a sprinkling of black pepper. fruity, notably spicy, and not too drying for its age in a relatively supple finish. £230"

"tomatin cù bòcan 1989 limited edition, 53.2%",Single Malt Scotch,87,337,"tomatin launched the peated cù bòcan expression last year, and follows it with a vintage variant, the result of “…a rare and unintentional production of peated whisky at the distillery on 7th june 1989.” three bourbon casks yielded 1,080 bottles. ripe apples and aerosol furniture polish, with a vanilla and sweet woodsmoke backdrop on the nose. full-bodied, with intense, sweet fruit notes on the palate, and a heathery, smoky kick. smoky spice and nutty flavors in the ultimately drying finish. £200"
"scott's selection (distilled at 'north of scotland,') 1963, 46.8%",Grain Scotch Whisky,87,120,"antique gold. thought-provoking aromas and flavors of molasses, leather, vanilla, and wood spices, with a hint of bourbon and rum. light to medium in body. given that this whisky is so mature and rather light in body, it has held up very well-the woody dryness is balanced nicely by the sweetness of the grain. 
"
"the antiquary, 1977 vintage, 46%",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,300,"deep on the nose and palate, with notes of dark rum, dried fruit, roasted nuts, dark chocolate, cinnamon, polished leather, charcoal, and a suggestion of peat.  dry, resinous finish.  bonus points for intrigue.
"
"the antiquary 35 year old, 46%",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,460,"the aromas can be split into four; fresh fruits (raspberry, blueberry), desserts (vanilla custard, bread and butter pudding), antique shop (polished furniture, well-oiled moving parts), and stewed fruits (apple, rhubarb, some old orange peel). wisps of balsa wood smoke; tangy orange notes build, accompanied by those fresh fruits, sweet oak, aniseed, and white pepper ending on black treacle and gingerbread. the finish is epically long; dry, floral, with parkin, residual wood notes, and further smoke evident. (800 bottles)"
"eades “double malt” islay (second edition), 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,70,"a marriage of two whiskies: 30% 18 year old caol ila finished in chateau d’yquem sauternes casks and 70% 10 year old bowmore finished in grenache wine casks. a honeyed, sultana sweetness (from the d’yquem?) nicely tames the rooty smoke, iodine, seaweed, brine, pepper, and subtle spanish olive. bramble and berried fruit (from the grenache?) add another layer and dimension. a very dynamic whisky, worthy of exploring and debating how well all these flavors integrate with each other."
"wemyss “a matter of smoke” 15 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,130,"peat smoke indeed, and it dovetails nicely with light toffee, vanilla, anise, charred oak, blackberry, seaweed, kalamata olive, brine, and peppercorn. well balanced from start to lingering smoke finish, and very exciting. (exclusive to the u.s.)"
"wemyss malts ginger spice (distilled at glenrothes) 1988, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,164,"glenrothes always has a spicy element, but this example ups the ante considerably and, true to the label, it’s fresh-cut ginger root alongside galangal and coriander, a hint of green grass, and even a little bite of jelly babies, alongside black currant leaf. rothes’ normally languid air is here frothily exuberant, with just sufficient vanilla thickness to offer a brake. uplifting and good. £107"
"wemyss malts heathery smoke (distilled at caol ila) 30 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,230,"sweet oak and cod liver oil are what greet you, with fleshy, lychee-like fruits
behind. the smoke here is very polite, giving way to fruit jelly cubes and
peaches, to develop alongside crisp apple. the palate is clean with nutty oak, with
the smoke continuing in the background, offering an extra layer of complexity.
fresh, belying its age, while it has typical tongue-coating oiliness it remains
understated. caol ila basking in the summer sun. (u.s. only)"
"wemyss malts (distilled at tormore) 1988 floral trellis, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,189,"the nose is sweet (think barley sugar/boiled sweets) with little bits of wheat chaff flying around in the background with dried flower petals and drying cut grass. opens dramatically with water into almond milk/horchata and flowers. the palate is sweet and lifted with those gentle florals to the fore. instead of tormore’s normal nagging rigidity, this flows sweetly over the tongue, leaving fruit leather, stewed rhubarb, and with water, rosewater and fresh wild strawberry. a lovely tormore! £118"
"wemyss malts stem ginger preserve (distilled at mortlach) 1995, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,133,"this is mortlach in musing mode. an aroma that initially brings to mind a woolen mill, then opens into sweet spice, light syrup, with the sense of the distillery’s weight always present. a rippling kind of muscularity with some rapeseed oil. with water the palate starts lighter and more fruity than you’d expect, then comes rooty weight with, yes, a distinctly gingery slant. water shows more beeswax/honeycomb. substantial and spicy. £85"
"wemyss malts waffles and ice cream (distilled at clynelish) 1997, 54.2%",Single Malt Scotch,87,144,"released in wemyss malts’ cask strength single cask releases range. this expression of clynelish was aged in a refill hogshead. initially, big coffee and ginger notes on the nose. sweet orchard fruits develop in time along with a pinch of table salt. very sweet and spicy on the palate with icing sugar and soft toffee. salt, white pepper, and light oak in a long, spicy finish.

"wemyss malts (distilled at invergordon) mocha moment 1988, 46%",Single Grain Whisky,87,127,"a rather moreish grain, and wemyss certainly nailed the chocolate orange aromas on the nose here. bright bursts of rich orange and comforting milk chocolate accompany gentle underlying spices, star anise, treacle-drizzled hams, and godiva mint pearls. the palate is easygoing, with chocolate muffins, condensed milk, dates, and milky coco pops. there is oak, but it’s never obtrusive, and of course, cold mocha that fades slowly, until the moment has passed. (240 bottles) £102"
"black bull kyloe, 50%",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,29,"kyloe is the old scots name for the famous hairy, horned breed of highland beef cattle, better known in scotland as a heilan coo. this bright nas whisky has aromas of fresh orange, lemon, grapefruit, and light muscovado sugar. it is soft and sweet to drink, with lemon sherbet notes, some fruity piquancy, and rich butterscotch, with some peppermint creeping in on the finish."
"anchor bay, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,48,"lombard’s blend of speyside malts pleases with an agreeable nose of orchard blossoms, flower honey, caramel, dry hay, and pears baked in brown granulated sugar. it’s homey and comforting, favoring its floral and fruity side. this is a light, sweet whisky that sweeps around the mouth, radiating maltiness, apple, grapefruit, dried mango strips, and mingling spices. a studiously long finish of sucked caramel candy and beeswax follows. a smart choice for the beginning of the evening. £30"
"old masters freemason whisky, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,30,"originally created by lombard for the freemasons, this has a flavorsome nose of dark chocolate chip cookies, light spices, coconut macaroons, malt, and bright, fresh bananas. the palate is light and unobtrusive, with honey and malt reinforced by the spices running underneath. a shift develops to some later cocoa and chocolate notes, and the mocha finish fades gracefully. a finely balanced concoction, and you will rarely find this quality and flavor for the price"
"kilchoman, winter 2010 release, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,63,"aged in both refill and new bourbon casks. the new bourbon casks are evident, and i think it adds richness, vibrancy, and perceived maturity (which i like) when compared to the previous summer 2010 release. very pale in color. brooding, with licorice root, coal tar, bacon fat, damp peat, bright fruit (citrus and pear), and intriguing botanicals, all on a soothing bed of vanilla malt. smoky, briny finish. i’m still amazed how this very young whisky can taste so mature. well done! "
"kilchoman 100% islay (distilled 2008, bottled 2011), 50%",Single Malt Scotch,87,100,"the only islay distillery not on the coast — and the most westerly on the island — kilchoman is reviving the tradition of farm distilling, and this limited edition release uses locally grown optic barley malted at the distillery. very creamy, with some stewed apple, green banana, and (when diluted) sponge cake mix. the smoke develops on the palate, adding an earthy note. rich, with some clove and licorice on the finish. well worth a look. "
"kilchoman 100% islay 3rd edition, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,87,92,"here you have the sweetness of rising bread alongside scallop and wreathes of smoke, all lit by west coast sunshine; the peat isn’t dank, but bright and flaming. the palate is sweetly seductive before the smoke begins to come through, then it sweetens like golden syrup, then the shore comes back, and so it continues. water ups the impact of each, so be careful, as it can then seem disconnected. sweet, beachy, smoky. very islay."
"kilchoman coull point, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,76,"this strikes me as being the most overtly smoky of kilchoman’s recent bottlings, and also the sweetest. intense and very forward, there’s baked apple, humidor notes, honeydew melon, fresh shellfish. water brings out a putty-like youthfulness, so take it neat. the palate is amazingly sweet (think golden syrup), then the smoke folds itself over. a good—and well-priced—introduction for newcomers.(world of whiskies uk travel retail only) £45"
"royal lochnagar 'selected reserve,' 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,210,"so nice to see this whisky available here in the u.s. again. a more mature, more sherried expression of the standard royal lochnagar. rich, silky, and sweet, with molasses, nutty toffee, old demerara pot still rum, caramelized fig, marmalade, and juicy oak. more subtle notes of honeyed ginger, coffee grounds, and tobacco leaf add complexity. a soothing post-prandial dram."
"adelphi (distilled at glen moray) 27 year old, 56.8%",Single Malt Scotch,87,158,"each independent bottler has its own signature style. adelphi’s is about relaxed, contemplative drams with rich maturity and a certain seriousness. here you see this, plus crème brûlée, sitting in front of a sandalwood backdrop with a bunch of basil mint thrown in. the opening is slow, and while the inherent sweet nature of the distillery is there, hazelnuttish oak helps to add structure and stops any flabbiness from intruding. a luscious dram. £99"

"kilkerran work in progress vii – bourbon, 54.1%",Single Malt Scotch,87,85,"the 2015 work in progress releases are the last before the single malt becomes a permanently-available 12 year old in 2016. 6,000 bottles are available. creamy malt, marzipan, and vanilla on the nose, with pears, instant coffee, linseed, and a hint of table salt. soft and slightly oily on the warm, spicy palate, with immediate ripe apples, caramel, and slight smokiness. long and slowly drying, with a touch of aniseed and brine."

(10,800 bottles)"
"clan denny (distilled at port dundas) 1992 21 year old hh9452, 55.7%",Single Grain Whisky,87,108,"there’s little quality port dundas being bottled, so don’t pass up the opportunity for this one. it evokes aromas of grated milk chocolate, grilled pancakes, apricot, mango, and poached pear jell-o, with spice notes of ground cumin, cinnamon, and nutmeg. this is simply delicious: a honey pot of sticky sweetness. a rich, cask strength grain whisky with notes of mandarin and candied jellies. a dash of water enables the sweet, creamy flavors to swirl around the mouth. £64"
"adelphi breath of islay 13 year old, 56.6%",Single Malt Scotch,87,101,"the latest bottling of “breath” is like a whisky smuggler’s tale. there’s the smell of old waxed walking boots, wet moss, damp earth, crushed bog foliage — heather, bog myrtle — burlap sacking, and a hastily smothered fire. the smoke is well controlled all the way, which helps to allow its scents to run over bitter coffee and a balancing central sweetness. robust, hairy, and uncompromising, this is less of a breath and more of a roar. £65 "
"that boutique-y whisky company (distilled at kilchoman, batch 1), 55.5%",Single Malt Scotch,87,117,"startlingly herbal. penetrating, lifted, and aromatic with dill, mint, and in time, celery leaf and lovage. smoke is akin to freshly-laid tarmac with some sweet seaweed behind. lively and quite different to the official bottling. water brings unripe pineapple, clove, sugared almond, and horseradish. this has typical kilchoman sweet creaminess in the center. water brings out flavors of nettles, and saltiness. £69"
"that boutique-y whisky company islay blended malt #1 23 year old, 46.3%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,102,"this is a sophisticated and finessed take on islay blended malt, which must be kilchoman-free given the age statement. driftwood, waxy lemons, soft buttery fudge, banana milkshake, dry grasses, and the gentlest puff of smoke promise calm seas ahead. a silken dram, anointing the palate with lemon meringue pie, honey, and caramel. this becomes creamier, with faint tendrils of smoke and dancing spices through to the finish. utterly charming and tremendous value for the money. (419 bottles) £82"
"that boutique-y whisky company blended whisky #1 (batch 2), 52%",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,178,"if you like warm chocolate ganache sprinkled with cocoa beans, dark waffle cones, praline, and brisket bark, then this is for you. a brief flicker of chocolate, smoke, cherry, peppery spices, and chili flakes move aside for a smooth medley of dark fruit juiciness and sweetened char notes. the strident call of chocolate on nosing goes unreciprocated on the palate. a long, satisfying, deep finish of pounding spices. a worthy successor to the first batch. (417 bottles) £123"
"that boutique-y whisky company (distilled at invergordon) 42 year old, 47.7%",Grain Scotch Whisky,87,106,"rich notes of baking chocolate, compacted dry earth, runny caramel, and garam masala highlight the versatility of aromas between these expressions. chocolate digestive biscuits, plain chocolate nibs, caramel, a hit of mouth-puckering pepper and chili heat, but the chocolate endures. a zinging finish akin to tache spiced bark."
"hankey bannister heritage blend, 46%",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,42,"hankey bannister includes some stunning aged whiskies in its range, but given the trend toward unaged scotch releases, i was a bit suspicious of this. it lacks depth but nevertheless is a butterfly in a breeze of a whisky; gossamer light, both tantalizing and elusive. it’s liquid honey, with sweet lime and pear, some cocoa, and to give it a modicum of depth, it’s underpinned
by a light saltiness."
"douglas laing old particular (distilled at glenburgie) 25 year old, 49.3%",Single Malt Scotch,87,190,"full gold. big, robust, and sweetly fragrant, with honeysuckle, stewing elderflower. there’s some oak, but it’s not dominant. the palate starts creamy, then there’s some caramel toffee with good distillery character. it melds freshness with the extra weight gained by gentle maturation. there’s coconut and cassia on the end. you lose the sweetness with water, but you get more blossom and oak. personally i’d go for it neat and sip slowly as a perfect summer dram. £130"
"douglas laing old particular (distilled at glen moray) 14 year old, 48.4%",Single Malt Scotch,87,83,"soft and direct. the initial impression is of birthday cake icing with marzipan beneath, then comes preserved lemon, greengage, and discreet maltiness. it becomes more scented (linden/privet blossom) in time. the palate is a little strong initially, then a hint of coconut. improves further with water, showing a fascinating, subtle evolution: herbal with iris flowers. a classy dram from an overlooked distillery. check it out. £53"
"douglas laing old particular (distilled at glenturret) 1987, 51.5%",Single Malt Scotch,87,151,"this glenturret was bottled in douglas laing’s old particular series at 28 years old. after maturation in a single refill hogshead it was released in early 2016. malt, milk chocolate, and honey on the pleasing, mature, rounded nose. figs and sultanas develop in time. smooth and rich on the palate with more malt, cocoa powder, and soft spices. very long in the finish with quite insistent spice, citrus fruit, cloves, and sweet oak. (168 bottles) £105"
"rock oyster, 46.8%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,59,"the final cornerstone of douglas laing’s remarkable regional malts range, this blended malt celebrates the best from the islands. the peat smoke finds harmony with the nose of pine, lemon curd, dewy lawns, and vanilla fudge. this is gloriously full-flavored; the peatiness certainly delivers, but there is a pleasant nip of saltiness too. the black pepper finish leads to a long lasting salty smack on the lips. make this your hipflask essential for bracing excursions along the shoreline. £38"

(u.s. only)"
"exclusive malts speyside 10 year old 2004, 57.7%",Single Malt Scotch,87,110,"this cask strength, port cask-aged whisky comes from an undisclosed distillery near aberlour. the impact of the port cask is unmistakable, with a nose that is deeply fruity with dried apricot, blackberry jam, honey, and malt. on the palate these rich sweet fruit notes are well balanced by black pepper, clove, salt, honey, and a touch of dark chocolate. the underlying proof also helps counterbalance the sweet fruit and drives a medium length and slightly dry finish. (u.s. only)"
"the exclusive malts (distilled at benriach) 17 year old 1997 (cask #144744), 54.3%",Single Malt Scotch,87,140,"benriach releases of this age are often peated or in a special barrel; here, we have an unpeated, non-barrel finish release. the nose is inviting, with honeycrisp apple, toffee, malt, and a touch of oak. a very flavorful entry presents lush toffee, apple, malt, and ginger. the spice increases in the mid-palate, as well as the heat, but we don’t get much added complexity. a long, flavorful, and slightly dry finish round out a very tasty but ultimately simplistic whisky.

"craigellachie 17 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,132,"golden, lifted, and aromatic. the fleshy ripeness of the 13 year old is still there, but that little sulfur edge has now gone, revealing the ripe fruits massing underneath. now you find pineapple and light chalk. the flowers have become daffodils and bluebells rather than lily, along with a soft, vanilla ice cream plumpness. sweet and full, and just a shade lighter than the 13 year old. muscly, but sweet; that’s the paradox of the craigellachie character. £83"

"grand macnish black edition, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,30,"i am hopeful this blended whisky has benefited from the alligator char treatment to contribute to the deep, rich color and charred smoke notes on the nose. a thick, velvety mouthfeel, with butter toffee, toasted marshmallows going gooey on a stick, great spices, vanilla, whole nutmeg, chicory, and the crust of a well-fired fruit loaf leaving some sooty cinders on the finish. a mighty fireside companion and my favorite grand macnish to date."
"girvan patent still proof strength, 57.1%",Single Grain Whisky,87,110,"apples squeezed in a cider press, sherbet dib dabs, and cinnamon sticks comprise the nose of this west coast grain whisky. it’s lip-tingling at cask strength; the lemon and molten honey tussling with the effervescence of the dib dabs before golden syrup pours over the tongue. it’s like crunching through a packet of powdery love hearts erupting in the mouth. water encourages peach fondant french fancies flavors, with a slightly pushy fruit skin note at the finish. £75"
"lord elcho, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,87,43,"lord elcho was an 18th century ancestor of william wemyss, who fought on bonnie prince charlie’s side at the battle of culloden in 1745. with a minimum of 40% malt, this fine blend has a rather perfumed nose of fresh mint, green apple, sliced melon, and tropical fruits. the soft candy sugar and butterscotch palate builds, with layers of malt, cherry laces, gingerbread, and pfeffernüsse leading to a ginger and spice finish of significant length. highly accomplished. £26"

"highland journey, 46.2%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,63,"this was inspired by stewart laing’s childhood journeys by steam locomotive from glasgow to speyside with his father. hunter laing’s blended malt includes contributions from blair athol, teaninich, and clynelish and raises toffee sauce, dried banana chips, and spring foliage, with a fringe of fresh mint. you can appreciate the cool, clean taste; ripe banana and chocolate-dipped fudge blooming into late notes of mocha, ginger, and chocolate mousse. dry finish of ginger cookies and espresso. all aboard! £40"
"haig club, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,72,"a confectioner’s delight; fry’s five centres, lime, lemon, kumquat, iced buns, fresh mint, and crushed cardamom that matches the chocolate aromas. those re-charred, rejuvenated casks are very much in evidence here. it has a gilded, satiny sheen, glistening with lemon drizzle cake, butterscotch, orange matchsticks, and banana bread. incontrovertibly, it inhabits a signature grain style, but it fizzles out with a sticky, sweet aftertaste, like licking the spoon from the icing bowl. £45"
"sovereign (distilled at cameronbridge) 23 year old 1990, 59.2%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,127,"appearances can be deceptive, as this pallid specimen proves. overripe honeydew melons, lemon cheesecake sprinkled with zest, vanilla pear muffins, cooked apple, spring blossoms, and icing sugar. the sweet, sugary opener is burnt out enjoyably by blistering burnt orange, butterscotch, and lemon bonbons. while the flavor intensity builds commendably, it doesn’t escape without a touch of astringency. water makes this sing ‘oranges and lemons,’ but go easy with it. the finish is like a greedy mouthful of tarte au citron. £80"
"duncan taylor (distilled at imperial) 1995, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,87,325,"fruits are to the fore here, super ripe, and dark in hue: think of plump plums, sweet black grapes, and hedgerow berries. that said, it is never heavy, as if it’s just the aromatics of the fruits which have been preserved. in time, some dried flowers emerge. the palate is equally sweet, with a little caramel and spice. it fades gently. impressive and well worth a look. i wonder whether the new dalmunach distillery will produce anything like this? £213"
"duncan taylor the big smoke, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,60,"the power of pure burning peat smoke, lemon-scented floor polish, pine needles, salt spray, and delicate vanilla places this squarely among the archetypal whiskies from islay. sweet lemon, custard cream biscuits, and hints of smoked goose lend an oily mouthfeel. a combustible climax of smoke, spice, and earthy peat kindle a red-hot finish that will have you puffing smoke like a chimney."
"douglas laing xtra old particular (distilled at garnheath) 41 year old 1974, 48.9%",Single Grain Whisky,87,277,"mid-period garnheath here, the distillery existing for barely 20 years. this brings aromas of freshly ground pepper, oils, soft fudge, and dry monkey nut shells. the fudge is smothered by spices exploding in the mouth: ginger, nutmeg, pepper, and cinnamon. warm toffees, oak, and citrus emerge late, but boy, this dram has great stamina and length. sure, the finish has an oakiness, slight sourness, and a gentle, spicy pepperiness, but water subtracts more than it gains. a genuine rarity. (141 bottles) £222"
"bruichladdich port charlotte scottish barley, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,87,72,"smoky, yes, but the effect is more shore-like: on the beach, hot sand, wood smoke, and a faint hint of balloons…there must be a party going on. in addition you get olive oil, preserved lemon, and eucalyptus. the palate is thick with strawberry sweeties that push back against the peat. water calms things (suggesting this would work with soda), while the finish sees the campfire emit more smoke. £45"
"ladyburn 41 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,1750,"ladyburn malt distillery was part of william grant’s girvan grain distilling complex in ayrshire from 1966 to 1975. it was located close to where ailsa bay now stands. this veteran bottling is mature and rounded on a nose of sweet pears, nectarines, subtle vanilla, and a hint of old hemp. fresh fruit and lively spice on the early palate, with worn leather and malt.  the fruit lingers through the very long finish with oak, licorice, and slightly bitter citrus notes."
"royal mile whiskies 40 year old, 47.1%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,288,"a terrific value blend of macallan, glenrothes, and tamdhu matured in sherry casks has produced one of the darkest whiskies on the market. inescapable aromas of thick seville orange marmalade, polished saddle leather, too-hot-to-hold sweet chestnuts pulled from a brazier, dry fruitcake, 100% cacao, and medjool dates. sweet prunes, chocolate ganache, cola, tannins, and singed wood spices combine to produce a formidable proposition. heavily sherried and oaky for sure; this has been bottled not a day too early. (337 bottles, royal mile whiskies only) £200"
"jura 16 year old diurachs’ own, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,87,65,"diurachs are the inhabitants of the isle of jura, and this single malt named in their honor is initially matured in bourbon casks before 2 years of finishing in amoroso sherry casks. floral and honeyed on the nose, with caramel, pine, and spicy dark chocolate. sweet and oily on the palate, where the chocolate changes from plain to milk, with vanilla and delicate cloves. darkening chocolate and drying oak in the finish."
"ancnoc rutter, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,87,65,"another expression from ancnoc’s first batch of peaty collection releases, this has the lowest phenolic level of the trio, at 11 ppm. initial peatiness on the nose gives way to sliced pineapple, nougat, and spicy vanilla. ripe apple, milk chocolate, and honey emerge out of soft peatiness on the palate. old leather and a hint of spice in the medium-length finish."
"grangestone 12 year old highland single malt, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,87,33,"the nose is inviting, with marzipan, malt, ripe bananas, milk chocolate, and cinnamon. green fruit notes emerge later. very sweet on the smooth palate, with bubble gum, satsumas, peaches, and delicate spice. the finish is medium to long and persistently sweet and fruity, with a hint of dark chocolate at the end. sure to satisfy a sweet tooth."
"rock oyster 18 year old, 46.8%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,116,"peat smoke dominates the nose of salt crystals, green tea, pine cones, peppermint creams, and charcoal. the tasty palate has sweet fudge, heather honey, and mandarin, which balance out the ginger and light pepper spiciness. smoke catches in the throat as it becomes fruitier in the later stages. finish is hot, drying, with smoke and ginger spices. decent enough, though its appeal will skew toward peat lovers."
"treacle chest, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,87,62,"the new wemyss family collection includes two blended malts; this is the better of the pair. raisin, date, fruitcake, stewed apple and plum, cumin, coriander, allspice, and new leather leave little mystery about the role played by the sherry hogshead. gingerbread, plum, and dark orange draw the mouth. fruity sweetness, but never sugary; there are jam tarts, walnut, and minimal interference from the spices until the dry finish. (6,300 bottles) £47"
"the famous grouse malt whisky, 12 year old, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,86,35,"lovely balance on the nose and palate. soft and gently textured, too. the sweetness of the whisky (honey, fruit gum drops, and malty vanilla), dovetail nicely with light, bright citrus and teasing dried spices. heather/floral notes enhance the whisky’s complexity. clean, delicately polished oak finish. a very versatile, inexpensive, easy-drinking whisky.

"chivas regal the chivas brothers’ blend 12 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,86,58,"intended to recreate the spirit of james and john chivas, this blend uses high proportions of longmorn and strathisla malts. the nose has green apples, peaches in syrup, blended honey, and oat flapjacks. a soft and light opener of orange sherbet, melon, and dried apple. dilution yields a delicious creamy texture with more assertive citrus flavors and bitter peel showing by the end. a distinctive character from the regular 12 year old, but this should be regarded as an equal. £40"
"chivas regal 12 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,86,25,"the assured scotch whisky that became one of the classic blends. dry and sweet, with a nose of vanilla sponge, fresh cut flowers, and marzipan over a malty base. pleasingly oily, with flavors of burning butter, malty toffee, and cake mix, with gentle spices and hints of chocolate appearing the longer you hold off swallowing. the glossy mouthfeel makes this feel like an everyday luxury. a finish of spent spices, cocoa, hazelnut, and a waft of smoke brings it home."
"duncan taylor (distilled at aberlour) dimensions range 1993 18 year old, 54.3%",Single Malt Scotch,86,110,"a light color suggests a relaxed contact between cask and whisky, but what this lacks in terms of ‘woodiness‘ it makes up for in all-round deliciousness. aberlour is often masked with plenty of sherry and/or bourbon oak; here the distillery character is thrust to the fore and comes out as being highly aromatic. there are candies, bubblegum, kiwi fruits, and cut flowers. the palate is vibrant with a touch of parma violet and pear juice. altogether a little charmer."

"arran 14 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,70,"this expression from the isle of arran distillery appeared in 2010 and one-third of the component whiskies were matured in european oak casks while two-thirds came from american oak. very fragrant and perfumed on the nose, with peaches, brandy, and ginger snaps, plus vanilla and mild oak. smooth and creamy on the palate, with spicy summer fruits, apricots, and hazelnuts. the lingering finish is spicy, biscuity, and slowly drying, with just a hint of salt."

"auchentoshan, 40 years old, 41.6%",Single Malt Scotch,86,1500,"it always amazes me how well this triple-distilled lowland whisky ages. the best ones are in their twenties and thirties. this one, at 40, is still holding up quite well, all things considered. lively, fragrant aroma for such an old whisky. notes of vanilla, coconut cream pie, butterscotch, hay, wood shavings, sultana, dried citrus, and a potpourri of spice. some “old oak” notes emerging from time to time throughout, with a gently spicy finish. an expensive whisky, but those who pony up the money will enjoy it. 
"
"auchentoshan, 18 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,86,95,"when compared to its younger siblings, this whisky is deeper in flavor. the citrus becomes more dominant (glazed orange, tangerine marmalade), with added notes of caramelized nuts and maple syrup. a good dash of dried spices kicks in and the whisky becomes firm and dry on the finish. my favorite of the standard range is still the 21 year old expression, which has been around for quite some time."

(exclusive to travel retail.) price per litre."
"balvenie doublewood 17 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,86,130,"a limited edition bottling to commemorate the great david stewart’s 50th year in the business and, as befits this quiet man, here’s a release that rewards just sitting and listening. this gives more of a nod to cognac than speyside; something to do with the dried apricot, orange blossom, and golden syrup. the palate is gentle and layered, with more dried fruits, which are balanced by an almost jammy finish where, finally, some cereal is glimpsed."
"balvenie 2004 13 year old, 58.2%",Single Malt Scotch,86,"60,000/set","this expression was aged in a european oak oloroso sherry butt. a savory opening to the nose, followed by figs dipped in lemon juice. sweet, spicy cream sherry on the palate, christmas cake flavors, then black pepper and tannins develop. the finish is medium to long, with honey and malt. accomplished, but expensive for its age."

(brighter and more dimensional than the other two reviewed here.) 
"
"duncan taylor (distilled at benriach), 34 year old, 1968 vintage, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,86,140,"benriach is a lesser-known whisky and, for a speysider, fairly light in style. this one is very bright and fruity on the nose with aromas of citrus (lemon), pineapple, green grapes, vanilla bean, honey, and linseed oil. its age is evident, but tucked away in the background. the palate mirrors the aromas and is quite complex. as you might expect for a 34 year old whisky, it dries out mid-palate with some grassy hay notes yielding to resinous oak towards the finish, but the oak never becomes excessive. i can’t remember the last time i tasted a benriach this good. 
"
"signatory (distilled at benriach), 12 year old, 1994 vintage, 59.5%",Single Malt Scotch,86,54,"a peated version of benriach that was also finished in a port pipe. there is a really nice blend of flavors here; a sweet malty foundation layered with ripe red fruit notes (raspberry, strawberry preserve, currant) and a firm blanket of smoke that goes on and on. all the flavors are bold, but they're equally balanced. not a subtle whisky but quite entertaining. (a binny's beverage depot exclusive.)"
"lady of the glen (distilled at benrinnes) 14 year old 1998, 57.8%",Single Malt Scotch,86,101,"this is a new bottler to me and they’ve made quite an arrival with this, a classic benrinnes. this is a distillery where meatiness is desirable, and this is as thick and savory as a slow-cooked pheasant stew or cassoulet, with an added herbal and pruney element. a real sweetness and a pleasing lift of sulfur (which can enhance whiskies) add to the complexity. chewy on the tongue, with earthiness revealed by water. £65  "
"bladnoch 1993, gordon & macphail connoisseurs’ choice range, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,86,70,"this most recent connoisseurs’ choice bottling from scotland’s southernmost distillery has been matured in refill sherry hogsheads. the nose is pleasing and light, mildly herbal, with cut grass, citrus fruits, and a hint of malt. medium-bodied, sweet and fruity in the mouth, with peaches, nuts, and discreet spice. relatively lengthy in the creamy finish. very drinkable and quite substantial."

"bowmore tempest iv/dorus mor, 55.1%",Single Malt Scotch,86,119,"tempest to the world, dorus mor in the u.s., this has an intensely salty start that’s
like being slapped by a wave on bowmore’s harbor wall. that marine note
continues: samphire, clams with a squeeze of lemon. water brings out wet clay.
the palate is equally briny, but with a sprig of lavender, then soft fruits
wreathed in peat smoke. it’s tense and coiled, with real energy when neat, but
it’s best like that, so deal with the heat."
"bowmore 23 year old port wood, 50.8%",Single Malt Scotch,86,630,"the ruby color gives the port maturation away, as does the nose: all plum crumble, stewed rhubarb, and caramelized orchard fruits. it’s more autumnal than jammy with hints of dusty angelica and only vestigial smoke. the palate is hot, with those hedgerow fruits and a light touch of perfumed lavender before a flock of tarry smoke appears on the finish. all well-integrated and at its best with a little water."
"bowmore vintage fèis ìle 2016 edition 25 year old, 55.7%",Single Malt Scotch,86,455,"this was a true double maturation: a dozen years in first-fill bourbon and then 13 years in claret. in its 20s, bowmore tends to shed its smoke and allows the soft fruits (here, persimmon, nectarine) which have always been there to show themselves. there’s a light oiliness on the tongue. the casks have added vanilla, red fruits, and spice, but the overall impression is of harmony and integration. lovely. (200 bottles) £350"
"bruichladdich sherry edition, oloroso, 1998 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,100,"less appetizing brine and zing, and showing more “weight” when compared to its sibling. sweeter notes of toffee, fig, and vanilla fudge lay the foundation for mixed nuts, black raspberry, plum, nectarine, and ripe red grape. a soothing dram.

(a d&m wines & liquors exclusive.)"
"bruichladdich scottish barley, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,86,68,"this has good breadth and hints of honey-nut cornflakes on the nose, with the distillery’s sweet, lemon-fresh/floral core still evident, but skewed more toward roasted notes, like toasted rice and sun-dried grasses; even a hint of the felt-festooned interior of a woolen mill. water brings out meadowsweet. raspberries lead on the palate, contrasting with the crisp, nutty chaff notes. it’s citric and gingery on the finish, but has drive and energy. £42"
"br5 elements of islay (distilled at bruichladdich), 53.8%",Single Malt Scotch,86,100,"the nose is slightly closed, all very delicate, with some hay-like aromas akin to harvest time. this gentleness allows sweet melon-like fruits to come through, alongside patisserie, icing, gentle vanilla, and an effect like hedione, the ‘smell’ of sunshine. rounded and very sweet, typical of the distillery, with a lightly drying effect similar to powdered icing sugar. it slightly loses it with water, so keep neat. a pleasant, straight down the middle laddie. £60/500 ml"
"bruichladdich 2001 15 year old (2016-1881-135-phd), 50%",Single Malt Scotch,86,123,"the official fèis ìle  2016 bottling. this is a mix of bourbon and wine casks given a period in virgin oak. the finish initially adds a certain sauna-like element, but then the distillery’s lemon drops and flowers come through, alongside baked apples, coconut, and a touch of smoke. the alcohol burn is negligible, allowing more estery elements, melon, and red fruits to come through. a classic laddie, in other words. (1881 bottles) £95"
"bunnahabhain westering home 17 year old feis ile 2014 bottling, 52.9%",Single Malt Scotch,86,421,"matured in cognac before being finished in sauternes; here we have a clean, sweet, and well-rounded bunna’, with hickory-like smoke, bonfire, and ginger biscuits. lightly vegetal notes with farmyard elements among the smoke and thick, citric sweetness. immediate smoke on top of this mix of spice, seville orange, apricot, cheesecake base, hazelnut, red fruits, and preserved ginger in syrup adding an almost peppery finish. lovely. £250"

"caol ila 14 year old special release 2012, 59.3%",Single Malt Scotch,86,103,"this is caol ila not only in unpeated guise, but from a ‘bodega-treated’ sherry butt. full and lush, the distillery’s pear and melon here are in super-ripe guise alongside sweet biscuits, mashed banana, and mars bar. with water, it’s more a cabinetmaker’s workshop—but isn’t woody. the mouth is sweet and concentrated with jabs of raspberry and hedgerow fruits. who needs peat? my best value bottling this issue.  "
"caol ila 15 year old, 61.5%",Single Malt Scotch,86,140,"unpeated caol ilas have become a regular in the special releases portfolio and this expression from 2000 is the eleventh to appear. the early nose is reticent and faintly floral, with freshly sliced green apples. sharp and sweet on the palate, with malt and citrus fruit, and even a hint of mint. ginger, mixed nuts, aniseed, and more mint in the medium-length finish. diageo special releases 2016 bottling."
"clynelish distillers edition 1993, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,86,74,"when this first appeared i found it too sweet, which was strange, as the finishing period is in dry oloroso casks. this most recent iteration sees the finish better integrated. there’s more spiciness than on the standard 14 year old, while the fruit seems plumper: more apricot and kumquat. the waxiness is there but the candle is scented. it still clings to the tongue, but there is an added nutty, oxidized character. a marked improvement.£47"
"duncan taylor (distilled at clynelish) 1990, 53.2%",Single Malt Scotch,86,125,"duncan taylor’s latest cask strength, single cask release from the sutherland distillery of clynelish is 21 years old. it is sweet on the nose, with hand-rolling tobacco, milk chocolate, overripe grapes, and vanilla. becoming saltier and drier. nutty and mildly maritime on the palate, with lots of spice, steadily drying. spice and ginger in the lengthy, oily finish. £80"

"
"dalwhinnie 15 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,86,65,"along with cragganmore, this is one of the underrated members of the original classic six. quite why has always slightly baffled me. ok, it isn’t smoky, but the nose has a deep, soft, honeyed sweetness: think caramelized fruits, hints of thick cream, and a light touch of fennel and sharp citrus. thick in the center and very gentle, it’s that chunkiness in the middle that is the secret to its beauty."
"dalwhinnie 25 year old special release 2012, 52.1%",Single Malt Scotch,86,300,"there have been three previous special release offerings of dalwhinnie, and this 1987 distillation is the first to have been aged in rejuvenated american oak hogsheads. cloves are to the fore on the aromatic nose, along with cinnamon, ginger, fudge, and tropical fruits. initially oily and honeyed on the palate, with developing spice, wood resin, and herbal flavors. spicy oak in the lengthy finish, with a return to the initial note of cloves. 5,358 bottles."

"
"edradour ballechin #5, 46%,",Single Malt Scotch,86,105,"the fifth peated release of edradour. this one is aged in marsala casks. sweet, with clinging fruit and thumping raw smoke. youthful, embracing, and fleshy in the middle, with ash, anise, and espresso that grow toward the finish. these ballechin releases keep getting better. reminds me of a young islay whisky without the brine and seaweed.

"glen scotia 18 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,105,"lemons, salt, and then malt on the nose. the palate is initially smooth, then fizzy fruits come through, with a hint of vanilla and slight brininess. the finish is well-mannered, with spicy soft fruits."
"glen scotia 15 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,85,"this 15 year old has been fully matured in bourbon casks. relatively reticent on the nose, with light vanilla. becoming more aromatic and spicy, with tinned apricots in syrup. medium-bodied, relatively dry, with ginger, oak, and cloves, before a touch of milk chocolate appears. the chocolate darkens. aniseed and perpetual spice."
"glencadam the exceptional 21 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,92,"clearly sharing the same dna as the 10 year old expression, this variant has less overt pear drops on the nose, which is altogether more floral and complex, with ripe oranges, pineapple, and an herbal note. elegant on the palate, with orange, vanilla; and contrasting dark berries, black pepper, and oak. the finish is lengthy and slightly oily. £57"

"glendronach, 12 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,59,"nicely sherried. rich, with maple syrup, honey-drenched citrus, sultana, and a good dried oak spice finish for balance. well done for a 12 year old, and definite competition for macallan of the same age. "
"glendronach, 1991 vintage, 18 year old, sherry puncheon cask #3182, 51.7%",Single Malt Scotch,86,110,"the variety between this series of single casks is quite extraordinary. this has a soft and light nose with some mint and liqueured fruit, and a big, rich, and impressive taste with anise and menthol, glacé cherries, and traces of mint. the finish is warming and full, with the mint and cherry theme carrying through to a slightly peppery conclusion. £71 "
"glendronach peated, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,48,"the first peated glendronach release, matured in bourbon barrels before a period in oloroso and pedro ximenez sherry casks. the nose offers dry, earthy peat, then becomes quite perfumed, with vanilla and lime. light to medium-bodied, with sweeter peat notes on the palate. creamy, with honey, cinnamon sticks, and green apples. the finish is medium in length, with peat slowly fading and a flaring of spices near the close."
"cadenhead’s (distilled at glendullan) 17 year old, 57.4%",Single Malt Scotch,86,100,"i always think that having “dull” in the middle of its name doesn’t do this distillery any favors. this is anything but; instead this is a fresh and vibrant example that brings on a whitmanesque reverie of chewing on leaves of grass: sappy, fresh chlorophyll, coumarin, lime. these scented grasses—now vetiver—remain in charge on the tongue. a rolling prairie in the mouth, and best neat."
"glenfarclas family cask 1964 (cask 4719), 48.5%",Single Malt Scotch,86,803,"a sherry butt this time, which has allowed the whisky a little more space to breathe. although as concentrated as you'd expect here, we can see more fragrance emerging and a big-boned elegance is on show — think margaret dumont. i pick up some rose hip syrup, dried apple, armagnac/prune, and a licorice note, as seen on the ’62; while on the palate, a good balance of rich chocolatey sweetness to offset the tannins. big but balanced. £512"
"glenfarclas family casks 1978 cask #4004, 41.3%",Single Malt Scotch,86,589,"the color is light gold, the nose is very sweet and delicate, with a floral aspect that’s not always immediately apparent in glenfarclas. this is from a fourth-fill hogshead, which provides creaminess, toffee, a little hint of orchid, burnt cream, and grilled peach. sweetly delicious. the palate is akin to bread-and-butter pudding, with that creaminess continuing. all very summery and ‘up.’ quite different, but appealing. £350"
"glenfarclas family casks 1984 cask #6032, 47%",Single Malt Scotch,86,1279,"delicate, with some jasmine, lily of the valley, and even, with time, the rich aldehydes of chanel no.5. this heaviness gives a butterscotch-like quality when water’s added, alongside apple. the palate is thicker than the light color suggests—it’s from a fourth-fill hogshead—with overripe pear and white chocolate; with water, becomes scented with an added touch of marzipan and chestnut puree. one for a thoughtful afternoon’s contemplation. £760"
"glenfiddich 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,37,"the world’s best-selling single malt. isn’t that sufficient to give this dram some respect? it might be me, but it strikes me that ’fiddich has more heft to it these days, with a sherried element giving the pear, apple, and light cereal of the distillery character a sweet, plump, sultana underpinning. this then adds chewiness to the palate, balancing the dry nuttiness and receding on the finish where those green fruits come through to add fresh acidity. great balance. "
"glenfiddich reserve cask, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,78,"here, a new solera vat is home to a glenfiddich that has been exclusively aged in sherry casks, and shows its origins with deep, black fruitiness, orange peel, and sultana. the signature pears of ’fiddich
here are dried and sit next to moist fruitcake. ripe and long, with toffee, a pleasant wisp of sulfur, and blackberry. an easy-going sherried style that’s ideal for the beginner. (travel retail exclusive.) £49/1 liter"
"glenfiddich select cask, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,62,"another from glenfiddich’s three new solera vats, here we can see the distillery’s light character turned up to the max thanks to a mix of american oak, red wine casks, and a smidgen of sherry. think of hyacinth, ultra-fresh william pear, light barley, and grass. zesty, clean and light, and ridiculously drinkable with a silky feel in the middle of the tongue. quite a bargain. (travel retail exclusive.) £39/1 liter"
"glenfiddich 26 year old, 43.1%",Single Malt Scotch,86,500,"pale straw in color, and while it is clean and fresh, it’s also very delicate, with elderflower blossom, dusty florals, and a freshly-starched linen note. all rather discreet, shy even, but effort reveals a subtly lovely dram. water adds a perfumed, green note. as the nose suggests, it’s not an immediate thruster of a malt, with some light jasmine tea and a little fleshy fruit on the end. tread cautiously, lest you scare it."
"glenfiddich 15 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,55,"i used to find this a little lacking in structure. either i’ve changed my palate (or was always wrong), or the solera’s slow changes have added depth and complexity. the nose is all cooked plums, with some blueberry, stewing rhubarb. all is delicately scented, with some currant leaf, then sultana and sweet dried fruits. the palate is equally fruity—more hedgerow fruits now—but there’s grip and a little fresh acidity to balance. hugely appealing and approachable."
"glen garioch, 1991, duncan taylor rare auld range, 51.1%",Single Malt Scotch,86,125,"melon notes to the fore early on the nose; floral, especially carnations. progressively more caramel, with parma violet sweets. pretty and feminine. richer and fuller-bodied on the palate than the nose might suggest. fresh fruit, apple juice, almonds, and gentle spices, slowly moving to milky coffee in the finish. the faintest hint of smoke pervades the flavor, but is very much a ‘bit part’ player in the ensemble.

"glen garioch wine cask matured, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,86,170,"this is the first expression from glen garioch to have been fully matured in wine casks, specifically tonneaux de vin rouge barriques from saint-julien in bordeaux. the whisky was distilled on june 23rd, 1998, and spent over 15 years in the bordeaux wood. milk chocolate-coated caramels, crystallized ginger, and cranberries on the nose. autumn berries on the early palate, turning to cough syrup, with rich malt and lively chocolate spiciness. caramel merges with white pepper in the relatively long finish."
"murray mcdavid 'mission' (distilled at glenglassaugh), 1986 vintage, 20 year old, 55.3%",Single Malt Scotch,86,175,"the ruby/antique amber color suggests a first-fill sherry cask; the nose and palate confirm it. this whisky is a mouthful: fruitcake, roasted chestnuts, burnt raisin, candied orange, molasses, leather, tobacco, dark chocolate, wax, and a hint of clove. an incredible amount of sherry, but it’s not cloying. the flavors are clean, complex, and well-balanced.
"
"glenglassaugh, 30 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,86,694,"an intriguing whisky. blueberry cobbler, crushed grape, maple syrup, nougat, and spice (cinnamon, nutmeg). the oak is polished and unimposing. liqueur-ish. a nice contrast to its younger sibling, and it’s more polarizing because of its distinctiveness. "
"glenglassaugh aged 37 years, 56%",Single Malt Scotch,86,625,"glenglassaugh distillery has released a number of country-exclusive expressions recently, including this 37 year old single cask (470 bottles) for north america, under the master distillers selection banner. initially, cornflakes and sherry on the nose, with developing vanilla and soft toffee. becoming very sweet. rich and notably spicy on the palate, with dates and dark chocolate. persistently spicy in the finish, with background citrus fruits."
"glengoyne, 12 year old, 57.2%",Single Malt Scotch,86,50,"a new, cask-strength glengoyne without chill-filtering. both features put this whisky in a higher class than the entry level 10 year old. that classic clean maltiness which glengoyne is known for is certainly in this whisky. with the addition of some water, the whisky really opens up, becoming fragrant, fruity (cherry pits, apples), along with hints of anise and almonds. a nice effort from the new owners. 
"
"glengoyne distiller’s gold 15 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,70,"distiller’s gold is exclusive to travel retail outlets and is dedicated to the distillery’s first manager, cochran cartwright, whose ghost is said to haunt the stirlingshire distillery. distiller’s gold displays a nose of brittle nut toffee and dried fruit, with vanilla and caramel notes emerging. spicy tropical fruits on the palate, with an edge of cinnamon and ginger. medium in length, pleasantly oaky, persistently nutty and spicy. price is per liter."
"glengoyne 15 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,86,75,"glengoyne’s core range has been revamped: the 12 year old cask strength bottling was replaced by one with no age statement, and this 15 year old was added. maturation has taken place in sherry casks and the result is a nose of vanilla, ginger, toffee, vintage cars’ leather seats, and sweet fruit notes. the somewhat oily palate features quite lively spices, raisins, hazelnuts, and oak. the finish is medium in length and spicy to the end, with cocoa powder. £48"
"glenkinchie 24 year old, 57.5%",Single Malt Scotch,86,450,"the third special releases cask strength glenkinchie is the oldest to date and the first to have been matured in european oak casks. peach and pear soufflé on the initial nose, followed by apricots and toffee. the palate is rich and smooth, with dark fruits, walnuts, nutmeg, and a hint of resin. quite lengthy, with ginger and white pepper in the aromatic and subtly drying finish. diageo special releases 2016. (5,928 bottles)"
"cadenhead's, (distilled at glenlivet), 12 year old, 60.5%",Single Malt Scotch,86,98,"amber gold color. rather sweet aroma and flavors of caramel, light toffee, almonds, and vanilla. a background note of fruit (lemon? ripe cherries?) contributes to its complexity. its body is somewhat rich and chewy. a dryness on the finish keeps the sweetness of the whisky in check. 
"
"gordon & macphail, 'smith's glenlivet', 21 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,86,125,"well-rounded and pleasingly sweet, with ripe red strawberries, raspberry, tropical fruit, graham cracker, white chocolate, and anise, all on a bed of toffee. some charred oak on the finish. this whisky has a gentle, soothing persona which i think most people will enjoy (me included).

"glenmorangie duthac, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,86,86,"this travel retail-exclusive from glenmorangie is the inaugural expression in the distiller’s new legends series. glenmorangie duthac is matured in a mix of charred virgin oak and pedro ximénez sherry casks. peaches, tangerines, cloves, vanilla, and toffee bonbons on the nose. silky on the palate, with warm spices, honey, intense tropical fruit, and fresh ginger. relatively long and creamy in the finish, with nutmeg, marzipan, and milk chocolate. price is per liter."
"peerless (distilled at glenrothes) 1967, 35 year old, 40.5%",Single Malt Scotch,86,135,"antique gold color. rich, thick malty aroma with interwoven notes of fruit, anise, and polished oak. medium to full in body and rich in texture and flavor, with chewy toffee, roasted nuts, vanilla fudge, and candied fruit. soothing finish, with a gentle sweetness balanced by a soft, leathery dryness. 
"
"glenrothes 1995, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,86,80,"this hails from the first of rothes’ stock that was specifically laid down for the vintage release program. the nose shows typical rothes softness — woolen blankets and malted milk. as it opens. there’s wet linen, caramel fudge, and a hint of mixed berry and dark fruits slowly collapsing into jam. a touch of sherried nuttiness on the palate is followed by thick clover honey and a little crisp malt. the finish is gentle, lightly spiced with a touch of struck match sulfur. "
"glenrothes 1979 editor’s cask #3828, 52.1%",Single Malt Scotch,86,956,"last year, four whisky editors were invited by glenrothes’ heritage director ronnie cox to choose a single cask bottling. being opinionated hacks, they couldn’t agree and so two casks were chosen! this, the oldest, from a refill butt, is for the european markets, and shows hints of rancio: truffle, leaf mold, boot polish, and star anise. the impression is of faded elegance with tannins, fruit, and spice in harmony, and a hint of pomegranate-like bitterness just on the end. £600"
"exclusive malts (distilled at glenrothes) 1996, 52.3%",Single Malt Scotch,86,140,"a very immediate, expressive, sweet start, with manuka honey dribbling on top of baked fruits, sweet citrus, and a dollop of clotted cream on the side. all very luscious and calorific. as if this dessert theme wasn’t sufficient, the palate lays it on even more thickly, with apricot now joining the mass of fruits. the light grip adds very necessary structure and stops things getting floppy. one for those with a sweet tooth. recommended.(u.s. only)"
"duncan taylor (distilled at glentauchers) 8 year old, 54.8%",Single Malt Scotch,86,84,"lightly grassy and hay-like, with some wheat chaff. the nose is quite hot, but that cereal note (reminiscent of draff) is pleasing, sitting alongside clean apple and orange barley water. the palate is sweeter and more floral (pear blossom) compared to the nose, though retaining some nuttiness. has good verve. when diluted, the finish shows real chocolate and some dry spice. a very interesting young ‘un. £54"
"gordon & macphail (distilled at glentauchers) 11 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,60,"a rare bottling from a distillery that is more commonly released as a part of whisky blends. light fruit and sweet malt define the nose, with apple, apricot, and honey. the entry is bursting with flavor, centered around malt, along with honey, salt, and apricot. the mid-palate adds a touch of oak, smoke, and spice, and is extremely well integrated and balanced. a medium-length finish ends abruptly and a little too dry, the only left turn in an otherwise superb whisky. (julio’s liquors only)"
"glenugie, chivas brothers, deoch an doras bottling, 32 year old, 55.4% ",Single Malt Scotch,86,410,"recently added to chivas brothers’ lineup of cask strength edition whiskies, this eastern highland single malt from the ‘lost’ distillery of glenugie in the fishing port of peterhead is perfumed on the nose, with discreet sherry, cocoa, fresh leather, blackcurrants, peaches, and apricots. the palate is initially sweet, with fresh fruit, but old-fashioned cough drops and black coffee notes soon arrive. very long in the spicy, tannic oak finish. exclusive to chivas brothers’ distillery visitor centers and www.maltwhiskydistilleries.com (500 bottles). £250 "
"gordon & macphail rare old (distilled at glenugie) 1970, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,653,"elgin distiller, bottler, and whisky merchant gordon & macphail has revamped its prestigious rare old range of veteran single malts, many from lost distilleries, and this bottling from glenugie in peterhead is one of the latest releases in the lineup. sweet on the nose, with marshmallows, wax polish, creamy caramel, and milk chocolate. quite full-bodied, with white pepper, ginger, muted citrus fruit, and cocoa. soon starts to dry…drying steadily through the nutty finish, with musty oak and aniseed. £430"
"highland park, cask #686, 1983 vintage, 22 year old, 56.4%",Single Malt Scotch,86,175,"dark and complex. sweet notes of toffee and caramel are spiced with notes of cinnamon and cocoa. background notes of smoldering peat, oak resin, and clove add intrigue and balance the sweetness. long, resinous, dried spice finish. (bottled for sam’s wines and spirits) 
"
"highland park, 24 year old, 1981 vintage, cask #3252, 45.3%",Single Malt Scotch,86,180,"a lush highland park, aged in a sherry cask. ripe fruit (sultana, apricot, dark cherry pits), layers of sweetness (toffee, nougat, molasses) almonds, and juicy oak. hints of vanilla cream, honey, heather and polished leather add dimension. this sherry contribution is clean, not overly sappy or waxy like others i have tasted. (bottled exclusively for binny's beverage depot.)"
"highland park harald, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,96,"harald fairhair was king of norway and a major figure in viking history. this warrior variant takes us closer to highland park’s traditional dna, with the nose offering potato peels on a barbecue; earthy and herbal, with developing notes of heather in bloom and even violets. lively fresh fruits, newly-baked cake, nutmeg, and ginger figure on the palate. the spicy finish is relatively long, with candied citrus peel and licorice. €75/700 ml"
"adelphi fascadale 12 year old batch 5 (distilled at highland park), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,69,"the fifth batch of adelphi’s fascadale single malt comprises a marriage of two spanish oak casks and three american oak casks of highland park. the outturn is 1,483 bottles. icing sugar, vanilla, milk chocolate, apricots, plus mildly smoky malt on the nose. full-bodied and fruity on the palate, with toffee, black pepper, and a hint of peat in the background. the medium-length finish is slowly drying. £45"
"sigurd, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,86,202,"heather honey, malt, newly-cut hay, pineapple, and very slight smoke on the nose. leather, malt, cinnamon, a touch of oak and soft smokiness on the palate. medium in length, with a hint of honey behind the oak, spice, and smoke. (travel retail exclusive.) €150"
"highland park freya 15 year old, 51.2%",Single Malt Scotch,86,235,"freya is the third release in highland park’s valhalla collection; unusually, it has been matured in first-fill bourbon casks. it fits into the core range between the 12 and 18 year olds. the nose is sweet, floral, and heathery, with pineapple, mango, and a background earthiness. finally, vanilla and milk chocolate. smooth on the palate, with passion fruit, and more overt peatiness than is apparent on the nose. subtle peat, char, and a hint of licorice in the finish."
"hart brothers (distilled at inchgower), 26 year old, 1976 vintage, 49.9%",Single Malt Scotch,86,140,"a coastal speysider, and this is evident in many of the inchgower bottlings, including this one. this is quite a fruity dram, with notes of tangerine, lemon, and kiwi. soft vanilla, coconut, and honey play in the mix, with a lingering salty/seaweed tang on the palate for intrigue. very clean, light, and surprisingly reserved in oak notes, considering its age. 
"
"provenance (distilled at inchgower), 14 year old, 1990 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,70,"technically a speyside whisky, but it tastes more like a coastal northern highlander. the foundation of this whisky is a lovely honeyed maltiness. it is aged in a sherry cask, which provides layers of rich toffee, caramel, and orange marmalade. brisk sea salt notes emerge on the palate keeping the whisky fresh and quite lively-the coastal influence-while deft seaweed and spice add complexity. 
"
"isle of jura, 16 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,86,48,"antique gold. gentle aromas of oak, caramel, and a hint of vanilla and sea breeze. light-medium body, with a creamy texture. soft, gentle flavors of vanilla, toffee, subtle fruit and brine, with a dryish oaky finish. 
"
"isle of jura superstition, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,86,35,"amber gold color. medium bodied and slightly oily. peaty bonfire aroma and flavors, complemented by a creamy caramel maltiness. subtle notes of brine, seaweed, and a hint of pear fruit spice things up a bit. gently dry, moderately smoky finish, with teasing sea salt notes. i have always wondered what a peat smoke infused isle of jura whisky would taste like. i was also concerned that too much peat smoke could dominate this whisky's flavor profile. fortunately, this hasn't happened. the peat smoke is certainly evident, but the jura character comes through too. one extra bonus: it's bottled at 45%, which kicks the flavors up a notch."
"lagavulin 12 year old, 55.1%",Single Malt Scotch,86,119,"though as pale as ever, this lagavulin is hardly in need of a charles atlas course. the nose is ozonic, like rock pools at low tide with kelp splattered around. sweetness comes in the form of cloudy apple juice and a smokehouse kipperiness. the palate is explosive, with masses of retronasal action showing violet root, thyme, juniper, tarragon/fennel, and a finish akin to smoked cheese. an improvement on the 2012 release."
"the exclusive malts (distilled at laphroaig) 2005 10 year old (cask #468), 54.2%",Single Malt Scotch,86,130,"extreme peat smoke explodes out of the glass. it’s diesely, burnt tire smoke more than campfire. past the peat, there's salt, paste, and honey. on the palate it's another blast of smoke. this nearly chokingly strong smoke dissipates slightly to reveal oyster shells, malt, paste, and honey. make no mistake, the smoke is the star and will remind you of that fact hours after you finish your last sip. an uber-peated whisky that hardcore peatheads will surely adore. (u.s. only)"
"laphroaig lore, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,86,125,"another nas laphroaig made from a blend of different cask types. the nose is dry and lightly tarry—a note that continues to the dried glass. there are medicinal phenols, a biscuity note, then an aroma of fuel, like being on a trawler deck. the palate shows integration between the oaks, lending a smokehouse aroma. water lightens, but you still get that smoky smear of phenol at the end that tells you this is laphroaig. like it."
"a.d. rattray (distilled at littlemill) 22 year old cask #558, 49.2%",Single Malt Scotch,86,160,"a non-chill filtered, cask strength single malt from littlemill, vintage 1991. littlemill’s sweet nose is inviting, with butter toffee, milk chocolate, dried apricot, and straw. on the palate, these notes are joined by a nice maltiness as well as a touch of salt. in the mid-palate we get a touch of spice (black pepper and cinnamon) and some citrus. the finish is medium-length and slightly acidic, a departure for an otherwise affable cask strength whisky. (park avenue liquor only)"
"distillery select 'craiglodge' (distilled at loch lomond), cask #329, 13 year old, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,86,70,"i’ve known loch lomond has been making some peated expressions, and it’s nice to finally see (and taste) some product being bottled with this whisky and its sibling croftengea, reviewed below. this is my choice of the two, with greater (and more richly textured) flavors to accompany the peat. the smoke is balanced (and tamed) nicely by sweet notes of creamy vanilla, honey, gristy malt, hay, and subtle fruit and spice. the finish remains balanced and lingers with a smoky, lightly salty tang. fresh and youthful, yet still nicely matured at 13 years old, and a nice alternative to smoky islay whiskies. 
"
"blackadder single cask #1101 (distilled at longmorn) 1972 vintage, 31 year old, 45% abv",Single Malt Scotch,86,135,"a big and sappy longmorn, with notes of chewy toffee, juicy oak, candied fruit, sandalwood, citrus and even some distant smoke. the standard distillery issue of longmorn 15 year old itself is a big whisky-one of the biggest in speyside with its rich, malty foundation-but this expression kicks it up a notch. aging 31 years in a sherry butt injects this whisky with a lot more sherry character along with those woody, citrus spicy notes found in so many older whiskies. while not as clean as the distillery issue and its maltiness is somewhat masked, there’s a lot going on here to entertain the palate. and although one could argue that the sherry is a bit extreme, the equally extreme dry, spicy oak notes provide ample contrast. 
"
"murray mcdavid (distilled at macallan), 1990 vintage, 16 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,125,"finished (or ace’d -- additional cask enhanced -- as they say) in a madeira cask. soft in texture, and deceivingly seductive in nature. pleasingly sweet (honey, caramel, aromas of sticky toffee pudding) with lush summer fruit and gentle spice notes emerging towards the finish. a soft, pleasing macallan with everything in balance. nicely done."
"macallan masters of photography 3rd release 1991 cask #7023, 50.8%",Single Malt Scotch,86,2750,"this time we’ve got macallan in savory mode, even a little balsamic. the spirit shows its hand more than in the 1995, with typical macallan heft. now you are deep in a forest of yew and larch with a dark chocolate bar for sustenance. maturity has brought out leather alongside clove and resin. the palate shows a similar tomato note seen in the 1995 cask, with positive bitterness and wedding cake. though grippy, it has great balance. 285 bottles.  "
"gordon & macphail (distilled at mortlach), cask #8173, 1994 vintage, 13 year old, 58.5%",Single Malt Scotch,86,95,"richly layered. a veritable fruit basket, in addition to nutty toffee, caramel, cocoa powder, and toasted coconut notes, all balanced nicely by oak on the finish. nice maturity for a relatively young whisky. (bottled for maxwell street trading co.)
"
"mortlach 25 year old, 43.4%",Single Malt Scotch,86,1013,"the richest of the quartet. super-dense with a note of burnished brass, then light leather and cashew alongside sandalwood. the waxiness and tropical fruit typical of old whiskies is in the background before it moves into lanolin. the palate starts sweetly, with added liqueur cherries, earth, and smoke but for me, after the complex nose it fails to deliver, especially since it is so scarily priced. £600/500 ml"
"old pulteney (cask #4931), 1990 vintage, 57.8%",Single Malt Scotch,86,121,"fresh, briny, and very appetizing. mouth-coating vanilla, lightly toasted marshmallow, and a kiss of honey add a soothing balance, while pineapple, nectarine, gentle spice, and subtle seaweed offer intrigue. old pulteney has great potential if only given the opportunity. bottling at cask strength and not chill-filtered really brings out more of the whisky’s subtle complexities. i welcome more single cask, cask-strength pulteneys in the future. (a park avenue liquor exclusive.)
"
"old pulteney row to the pole, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,32,"explorer jock wishart’s successful ‘row to the pole’ expedition is celebrated with this 3,000 bottle commemorative edition matured in ex-american and ex-spanish oak sherry casks selected by distillery manager malcolm waring. new-mown grass, ripe apples, brine, and a whiff of  arbroath smokies on the nose. citrus fruit, spices, and milk chocolate on the palate, with sherry lending gravitas. the finish is sweet, full, and lengthy, with brine returning at the last. £20 (350 ml)"
"old pulteney 30 year old (2013 edition), 40.1%",Single Malt Scotch,86,384,"apart from the 40 year old expression launched in 2012, this is the oldest old pulteney on the market, and annual batches are
released with slightly varying strengths. refill bourbon casks have been used in their maturation. sweet and zesty on the deceptively youthful nose, with banoffee pie, eating apples, and quite sweet oak on the palate. cereal notes and pleasing oak in the lengthy finish. £250"
"duncansby head, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,75,"duncansby head has been aged in a mixture of bourbon and spanish sherry casks. the nose is initially slightly earthy; then old pulteney’s characteristic marine nature develops discreetly, along with icing sugar sprinkled on apple pie and a hint of roasted potato skins. the palate is smooth and chewy, with sherry making its presence felt along with cooked apples, oranges, sultanas, nutmeg, and cocoa. the finish is spicy and nicely rounded. £45/liter"
"old pulteney dunnet head, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,85,"dunnet head replaces duncansby head and consists of 80 percent sherry cask-matured whisky and 20 percent aged in bourbon wood. it is non-chill filtered. soft caramel on the nose, plus a hint of fresh ginger and meadow hay. sweet, spicy sherry and a heathery note on the nicely textured palate, with suggestions of citrus and salt. medium in length, with lingering soft spices in the finish; ginger and cinnamon at the close. (travel retail exclusive)"
"chieftain’s (distilled at port ellen), 1982 vintage, 25 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,86,280,"port ellen whiskies are getting pretty rare (and expensive). this one is softer and less vibrant than others that i’ve tasted, but still very much port ellen, and still enjoyable! notes of coal tar, rooty licorice, toffee, dark chocolate, and nougat, with background citrus gumdrops, ginger, brine, seaweed, peat bog, and damp oak. i think bottling this at 46% without chill-filtering, or perhaps even cask-strength, would have helped the flavors “zing"" (and elevated my rating)."
"cadenhead's, (distilled at rosebank), 11 year old, 57.5%",Single Malt Scotch,86,98,"gold color. soft, delicate aroma of fruit gum drops, vanilla, and a touch of honey. light in body, with a soft texture. its flavors are like its aroma, nicely balanced, with a gentle finish. 
"
"murray mcdavid 'mission' (distilled at royal brackla) 1975, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,150,"orange marmalade color. aromas of ripe fruit (orange, strawberry, red raspberry), caramel, and toffee, with a subtle, spanish oak resin spiciness. medium to full in body with a silky texture. nicely balanced on the palate and very well integrated flavors similar to the aromas. silky smooth finish. 
"
"douglas laing old malt cask (distilled at royal brackla) 12 year old, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,86,79,"the old malt cask ‘royal jubilee commemorative bottle’ appropriately comes from one of two surviving scottish distilleries with a ‘royal’ prefix, namely brackla, located in the northern highland region, near nairn. maturation has taken place in a refill sherry cask. the nose is like a damp, empty house, with herbal notes, pencil shavings, oranges, and pine needles. full-bodied and spicy, with freshly-sawn timber, pine, and brittle toffee on the palate. citric, with camphor and pepper in the finish. 250 bottles. £50"
"royal brackla 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,75,"as part of its program to make available single malts from all five of its scotch whisky distilleries, bacardi subsidiary john dewar & sons has now released a trio of bottlings from royal brackla, situated near nairn in the scottish highlands. the 12, 16, and 21 year old expressions are initially available in ten markets, including the uk, u.s., and canada.
the nose offers warm spices, walnuts, malt, peaches in cream, honey, vanilla, and a slightly herbal, earthy note. quite robust on the palate for its strength, with spice, sweet sherry, and mildly smoky orchard fruit. the finish is relatively long, with cocoa powder, citrus fruit, and ginger."
"springbank, 12 year old, 50% abv",Single Malt Scotch,86,58,"(reviewer's note: this is a bottling exclusive to sam's wine & spirits in chicago, il.) springbank bottlings over the past few years have been variable, but improving. the less inspiring ones have been too heavily sherried and/or lacked the classic springbank freshness, liveliness, and briny character one has come to expect from a campbeltown whisky. this one is indeed from a sherry cask. it's still not the classic springbanks we were spoiled with in the 1990s, but it's delicious nonetheless. yes, there's plenty of sherry (and these notes contribute lush fruit, toffee, and nuts), but the youth and zest of this whisky cuts through it and balances it nicely, with those familiar brine and coconut notes interwoven throughout. a bold and satisfying springer, with more character that the 175th anniversary 12 year old distillery bottling that has been in circulation."
"springbank, 15 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,115,"powerful, mature, and nicely rounded. similar in some ways to the springer 10 year old 46% reviewed below, with the addition of toasted coconut and caramel. it’s also more rounded and with greater depth. 
"
"springbank, oloroso sherry butt, 12 year old, 51.5%",Single Malt Scotch,86,113,"full sherry impact, but the springbank character does manage to fight its way through it. thick, sweet notes of toffee and molasses are accentuated by dark raisin, golden raisin, prune, date nut cake, and fruit gumdrops. nutty, briny, rhum agricole finish. a springbank for sherry lovers. (from a single cask, 591 bottles, exclusively for the u.s.) "
"kilkerran, 60.3%",Single Malt Scotch,86,95,"visit springbank’s tasting room and you’ll find distillery-only bottlings of all three whisky styles produced by the campbeltown distillery. but it’s this malt that will probably attract the most interest. glengyle was officially re-opened in 2004, and in recent years springbank has released a work in progress each year. what makes this unusual is the fact that the maturing malt is held in a cask which is kept at least half full, and each year it is topped up with malt from 2004, through the solera method. this year, then, the oldest malt is six years old. the nose definitely suggests a work in progress, and is immature, rootsy, and meaty, though some orange and citrus fruit notes are there, too. on the palate there’s plenty to be encouraged by, with some spearmint and menthol, developing fruitiness, earthy peat, and distinctive salt and spice. "
"springbank 14 year old manzanilla cask (#259), 54.8%",Single Malt Scotch,86,100,"a round of single cask springers matured completely (not finished) in various wine casks for the u.s. market. all four are solid efforts — it’s really a matter of personal preference. a general comment: most of the single cask releases are matured in some sort of wine or rum cask. while this is nice, i would love to see several single cask, cask strength, and fully-matured ex-bourbon barrel bottlings offered for a change. 

complex citrus (orange, tangerine, lime, and a hint of lemon), honeyed malt kissed by maple syrup, caramelized pineapple, cinnamon, and a dusting of nutmeg. nutty toffee on the finish. "

what you might expect a traditional 100% oloroso sherry cask-aged springbank to taste like, with probably the most familiar flavor profile of the four: rich, with nuts and dried fruit, chocolate-coated brittle toffee, plenty of spice (cinnamon, ginger), polished oak, hint of tobacco and smoke. "
"springbank green 12 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,90,"this bourbon-cask matured 12 year old was distilled using organic barley. 9,000 bottles released globally. pears and pineapple in brine on the early nose. peanut brittle, licorice, and subtle peat. sweet and intensely fruity on the viscous palate, with developing nuttiness, vanilla, spice, and peat smoke. the finish is medium in length, with sweet fruit, more licorice, and sea salt."
"talisker distillers edition 2000, 45.8%",Single Malt Scotch,86,83,"the immediate shore-like blast suggests that the sweet amoroso casks haven’t been overly enthusiastic in their embrace. what seems to have happened is that while giving some date and prune they have added an extra layer of oak — giving a charred element — and, like lagavulin, hints of tar. the smoke is obscured and the pepper is javanese. it’s a polite talisker, but the absorption of the smoke means it has lost something integral to its being. "

chocolate here: chocolate brownie mix to be precise, with a raspberry sitting

"islay mist, 12 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,86,50,"more rounded, with greater depth when compared to the 8 year old offering. not as medicinal and less sweet, more toffee and less honey, with more dried spice interwoven throughout. the herbs are still there, along with licorice root. dry, burning-ember finish. nicely balanced, which makes it my favorite of the three.

"duncan taylor nc2 (distilled at balmenach) 2000 9 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,55,"young it certainly is. precocious even, and a pallid-looking youth on first impression, but behind that bland exterior is freshness and life with a fragrance that is very un-balmenach, all chilled muscat grapes, melon, even some cucumber. this general perfumed zinginess continues on the tongue, though the weight of the distillate (balmenach has worm tubs) anchors it well. it’s not about age — it’s about character. enjoy. "
"glen moray elgin classic chardonnay cask finish, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,30,"after 6 to 7 years of maturation in bourbon casks, this spent several months in chardonnay white wine casks. the nose offers resinous wine notes, melon, grapefruit, and a hint of vanilla. nutty on the palate, with orchard fruits, more vanilla, and milk chocolate. peaches and a slightly oily note in the finish, with apples, nutmeg, and a sprinkling of black pepper."

"the black grouse, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,86,29,"one might assume this to be just a smoky version of the standard famous grouse (with its honeyed malt, bright fruit, and floral demeanor). but, in addition to the enhanced smoke (which caringly adds a new dimension without smothering the other flavors), there also seems to be more malt body and oak spice in the mix, which i think takes black grouse to a higher level than famous grouse. the grain whisky contributes a “drinkability” component, making it a great introduction to smoky whiskies."
"kilkerran work in progress 5 bourbon, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,58,"the first kilkerran “work in progress” bottling from glengyle distillery appeared in 2009, and the ultimate aim is to bottle a 12 year old expression. for now, we have separate sherry butt-matured and bourbon barrel-matured expressions for 2013. the bourbon-aged variant offers vanilla, cinnamon, milk chocolate, ripe apples, and ultimately, slightly smoky mango notes on the nose. spicy on the palate, with blood orange and a hint of peat smoke. the medium-length finish is drying, with a wisp of smoke. £38 "

"speyburn bradan orach, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,20,"speyburn’s entry level nas single malt takes its name from the gaelic term for “golden salmon” and was matured in bourbon casks. the nose is light and youthful, with malt, vanilla, and unripe apples, while the palate offers more malt and vanilla, plus dry, spicy oak. the finish is medium in length and grassy, with ginger and further dry oak."
"singleton of glendullan 38 year old (diageo special release 2014), 59.8%",Single Malt Scotch,86,1250,"mature on the nose, mixing the tropical fruits of age with blanched almond. as it opens, you encounter moscato grapes dusted with white pepper. grows in sweetness. the palate continues this theme with the fruits (blueberry, raspberry, and pomegranate) typical of the distillery character, given a waxy coating by age. unctuous and good. water rather pulls the flesh from the bones, revealing its age, so leave well enough alone. (3,756 bottles)"
"hazelburn 10 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,45,"this expression from springbank distillery is taking over from its highly regarded 12 year old sibling. it is unpeated, distilled three times, and matured in bourbon casks. it is non-chill filtered. the nose is gently floral, with pears, toffee, and soft oak, then emerging herbal tobacco notes. the palate is full and slightly oily, with cream, orchard fruits, cinnamon, and sea salt. the finish is long, with vanilla and cocoa powder."

"master of malt reference series ii, 47.5%",Blended Scotch Whisky,86,85,"now listen up class, it’s time for your next whisky lesson. here the educational blend contains 20% very old single malt, which delivers a nose of citrus peel, honey, air-dried ham, and some spices in the background. quite delicious, with orange, vanilla sponge, raisin, cremola foam assuaged by plain chocolate, and black forest gateau. this concoction is further tweaked three ways to complete reference series ii. a truly great drink in its own right that makes learning fun again. £56"
"master of malt single cask series (distilled at loch lomond) 18 year old, 60.5%",Grain Scotch Whisky,86,135,"the strength is immediately apparent, though the nose has a curious mix of potato chips, tarragon, salt, and fizzy sherbet. the palate is more fruity, quite syrupy and sugary, with a lift of honeycomb and spicy ginger. it develops spiced orange notes, lime, soft summer fruits, vanilla, and milka chocolate, encased in a thick, dense mouthfeel with nutmeg, dried peel, and powdered chocolate. a rumbustious dram at cask strength, but when tamed, it coaxes out ginger-sprinkled papaya and mango. (96 bottles) £89"
"ballantine’s 17 year old signature distillery editions – glentauchers, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,86,80,"glentauchers distillery is another chivas brothers workhorse located deep in the speyside countryside. through the aromas of honey, caramel, and vanilla peek barley stalks, hard pears, and hints of cadbury buttons. the flavor opens sweet, with red berries and parma violets. although this is intended to follow a lighter style, it’s very flavorsome, with creamy vanilla, poached pear, and dried apple. a juicy finish with fruitiness oozing from the cheeks."
"ballantine’s 12 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,86,38,"wow! a noticeable step up in quality than ballantine’s finest (see below) with a perceptibly higher malt content. after eight mints, rolo toffees, spring florals, clean and creamy, plus some wood combine to produce an appealing nose. one sip confirms that this is gorgeously honeyed, layered, thick, and creamy, with heather honey, sweet oak, and ripe fruits, especially orange and mango. the finish is short, drying, sweet, and the only weak spot in an otherwise decent composition."
"blue hanger 10th blended malt, 45.6%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,86,100,"with some powerhouse whiskies in the blend (including an '87 bunnahabhain), it’s a surprise that the nose is so reserved, with citrus, ginger, and honey. on the palate you need your flavor shovel to unearth a core of typically strong flavors, including leather, oak, salt, dark chocolate, and even rancio. it’s delicious but highly elusive. the finish is medium and quite dry. what an odd blend. i haven’t had to work this hard for a blend in a long time. (u.s. only)"
"blue hanger 8th release, 45.6%",Blended Scotch Whisky,86,115,"this breaks blue hanger ranks because it's a traditional blended whisky rather than a blend of just malts. not that you see the joins. this is a rich, powerful, clean, and crisp whisky with a delightfully balanced flavor of pureed fruits and an unusual, almost menthol quality. smoke wanders in and out to complete the experience.

"william grant’s 18 year old rare, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,86,78,"the last eighteen months have been very good ones for blended and blended malt scotch whisky. shackleton and compass box set out in a fresh direction and there were top releases from the likes of johnnie walker and blue hanger. so quality brands from the likes of grant’s have to rethink. this is well made, tasty, balanced, complex, and drinkable without water or a mixer. but shouldn’t a premium whisky justify a strength of 46% abv? i think so. £50"
"that boutique-y whisky company (distilled at speyside) 17 year old, 53.4%",Single Malt Scotch,86,52,"few single malt whiskies from the speyside distillery make it to the u.s. this noses like a gammon joint glazed with sliced orange and a side order of sugar mice. hesitantly, a sip brings relief with dark chocolate, stewed rhubarb, strained raspberry juices, walnut, and burnt bakery goods. dry finish with remnants of cocoa. worth experimenting with water, as lovely candied peel and golden syrup notes peek out."

(batch 3; 162 bottles)"
"that boutique-y whisky company blended malt #2 18 year old (batch 3), 48%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,86,62,"a delicious and inviting proposition, this offers heather honey on toast, marmalade, dark vanilla, and flapjack aromas. soft on the palate, there are gingersnaps dipped in thick-cut marmalade and runny caramels, though the ginger flavor muscles its way to the fore eventually. water promotes more candied peel, before a spearmint conclusion. this is really enjoyable whisky for those lucky enough to get their hands on it. (30 bottles) £50"
"shieldaig 14 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,86,60,"bottled by ian macleod distillers from an undisclosed producer, this islay single malt may well emanate from ardbeg. the nose offers lemon, rock pools, peat ash, and smoky malt, with a sweet, honeyed floral note at its heart. medium-bodied, with big citrus flavors, tingling spices, brine, ashy peat, and aniseed. aniseed lingers in the finish, with diminishing spiciness."
"royal salute the eternal reserve, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,86,180,"let me introduce you to infinity blending. 88 casks were blended and married in 88 casks for 6 months, then blended with another 88 casks. half is bottled, and half retained at strathisla’s royal salute vault for the next batch. the process is as fascinating as the whisky. caramel, toffee, green apple, jaffa orange, and vanilla pod aromas. dark sweetness, fresh orange accents: polished, juicy, and thirst quenching, though the brilliance lies in the amaranthine finish.

"douglas laing provenance (distilled at laphroaig) 8 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,86,92,"what would you expect from an 8 year old laphroaig? iodine, massive peat, aggression? not here. rather, there’s a soft marine sweetness akin to lobster thermidor, with hints of salinity and tarragon. it builds in heft, and smoke, but there is real balance. complex already. the palate initially shows muted smoke, and is slightly medicinal, with balancing creaminess. water shatters this idyll somewhat, as the phenols come out in full force. it depends what side you want. i’d grab some. £60"

(282 bottles) £83"
"bruichladdich octomore 7.1, 59.1%",Single Malt Scotch,86,168,"distilled in 2009, so remember this is only 5 years old. at this stage there’s not a lot of cask, but there is an insanely intense smoky, herbal note like eucalyptus, celery, spruce, pine resin, then some angelica and a crisp mineral edge. the palate is balanced between this intensity, big smoke, and bruichladdich’s typical oily, sweet core. water doesn’t affect it one little bit. it is bold, it is proud, it is in charge. i like its sheer ballsiness. £110"
"copper dog, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,86,32,"named after the warehouseman’s preferred piece of pilfering paraphernalia, the 125 year old craigellachie hotel’s copper dog bar now boasts its own whisky. it’s an appealing blend of eight speyside malts, with honey, warm toast, pecan nut, apple turnover, fudge fingers, and orange peel. vanilla, orange pith, wood spice, caramel, and fresh apple develop into creamy nougat. takes a while to come into focus, then concludes with a spicy finish."

" j. mossman platinum crown 15 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,86,54,"nutty nose, with toasted oak, savory peppered meats, and traces of wood smoke. it starts off deceptively lightweight, with sweet juicy mandarin before a takeover of sharper citrus elements. honey and gorgeous silky caramels slink by, chased by a gentle swish of spice. light pepperiness with chocolate notes ushers in an aromatic finish. a tasty blend, but the nose will not be everyone’s choice."
"cardhu 12 year old, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,85,45,"the decline in the spanish market has resulted in cardhu becoming more widely available, which is a good thing as far as i am concerned. this is a grassy malt, which at 12 years also has a heightened citric spray of sweet orange zest and a gingery aspect (it’s great with ginger ale). intense and vibrant with macadamia and a light heathery note, the palate confounds expectations, having a thick chewiness before the grass zings through, adding lift. "

"
"famous grouse mellow gold, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,33,"this has enticing flavors that will meet with the approval of the regular grouse drinker: heady florals with fresh peach, light honey, pecan, and underlying caramel. the palate is soothing with vanilla and tangerine, hallmarks of grouse, plus rosewater, almond, and whispering spices. gently does it, that’s the key to this: kick back and relax. this showcases the midas touch of gordon motion’s skills in liquid alchemy. a great value blend to boot. £22"
"johnnie walker explorers' club royal route, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,159,"i had to double check that price. my feelings are well recorded on premium whiskies bottled at 40% and if you were to ask me whether the whisky's worth the price tag, the answer's no. that doesn't make it a bad whisky, though; far from it. it has a light, dusty, and fruity nose reminiscent of raspberry sherbet, and on the palate there is trademark smoke, and pleasant toffee and treacle. good, but in stellar company here. (travel retail only) price is per liter."
"chivas regal extra, 40%, ",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,40,"a new oloroso-forward chivas positioned to split between the 12 and 18 year olds? i got this. refined and inviting nose of lemon pith, black fruits, and kola kubes. the velvety texture is wonderfully smooth, redolent of an apricot custard danish, lime zest, raisin, currant, mixed peel, and walnut, with a growing bitter-lemon note. quite unique finish, like sucking on lumpy spanish lemons speckled with spices. (la, ny, miami, chicago, northern california, but will go national)"
"dewar’s white label scratched cask, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,26,"what lies beneath the surface of dewar’s? here, the blend is finished in virgin and first-fill bourbon casks especially charred, then scratched to enable deeper penetration. thick wedge of vanilla and fudge with oaky accents, a dusty mouthfeel pulling in vanilla, light lemon, milk chocolate, and sweet toffee, ending on a cocoa powder note. compared with regular white label, this is less obviously sweet and creamy, adds complexity, and opens a bourbon connection. certainly, this is up to scratch."
"dewar’s 18 year old the vintage, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,80,"vanilla laced with spice, fondant icing, grapefruit peel, and lime zest leave the vanilla and floral notes lower down the pecking order. in the mouth, grapefruit and orange dominate the vanilla, yet the mouthfeel is thinner and the acidity tips toward the taste of bitter orange seeds. a lingering bitter orange finish."
" dewar’s white label, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,25,"honey, fudge, a little melon and white grape, dry roasted spices, and peppercorn, but noticeably less fruit than the age-statement varieties. the palate has pulpy white melon, lemon, lime, and some grapefruit acidity, before sweetening with honey. quite tart at times, some peppery spice collaborates before the vanilla cream and green fruits take charge. a clean, juicy finish of lemon zest and mild spices coats the throat."
"king's crest, 25 year, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,225,"delicate, yet nicely balanced. notes of peaches and cream, meadow flowers, subtle berry fruits, soft vanilla, and light honey. gentle, pleasing oak finish. nice dovetailing of flavors and very drinkable. a good example of a lighter-style mature blend, and quite the antithesis of the johnnie walker blue anniversary bottling reviewed above. a pleasing warm weather scotch, or perhaps before dinner as an aperitif. 
"
"gordon & macphail single cask #12274 (distilled at ardmore) 1990 vintage, 56.4% abv",Single Malt Scotch,85,65,"ardmore whiskies i’ve enjoyed in the past have been soothingly malty. many have also been recognizably smoky, which is rare for a speyside whisky. this one, aged in a first fill bourbon barrel, is true to its roots. it is a clean whisky, with a creamy, soothing maltiness throughout. the palate is entertained by notes of vanilla and honey, with anise, white pepper and a teasing smokiness. the thick maltiness and soft smokiness linger long on the finish. a very underrated whisky. 
"
"the arran malt, single sherry cask, (cask#69), 1998 vintage, 56.6%",Single Malt Scotch,85,80,"predominantly fruity -- the sherry cask is obvious, but it’s not heavy or dominant. clean, bright orchard fruit blends in nicely with strawberry rhubarb pie, light toffee, dates, dark chocolate, and polished oak. long, soothing, oily finish. another solid effort from this young distillery."

   general comments: as i have written in the past, lowland whiskies are known for maturing nicely at a younger age. but most people don't know that some (especially auchentoshan) are delicious at older ages too. as mentioned in my 'from the stills' column, older vintages of auchentoshan are now only being offered to individual retailers, one cask at a time, and this is one of those casks. it is one of many 1966 vintage auchentoshan whiskies i have enjoyed over the past 15 years. auchentoshan, from a balance and complexity perspective, seems to be best in the 20-30 year old range. still, having said this, this one holds up fairly well for its age. price: approx. $150. available exclusively at park avenue liquors."
"auchentoshan 1998, 54.6%",Single Malt Scotch,85,70,"this 1998 vintage triple distilled lowland auchentoshan has been matured in fino sherry casks, which are rarely used for scotch whisky maturation. the nose presents violets in fresh soil, honey, spice, developing citric fruit notes, and almonds. quite full-bodied, fruity and zesty in the mouth. lengthy in the finish, with spice, nuts, and oak. becoming dry and gingery at the last.

(travel retail exclusive)"
"balblair, 1991 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,85,130,"here’s the older sibling to the 1997 vintage released in u.s. at the same time. it costs twice as much as the 1997 vintage, and guess what? i like the less expensive 1997 vintage better (because of its lovely balance and creamy texture). still, this 1991 vintage is a nice whisky, rich with vanilla, coconut cream, citrus (orange, tangerine), pineapple, and sultana. a soothing, mouth-coating texture lingers, with some polished oak on the finish.

"balvenie peated cask, 17 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,85,130,"the newest release in balvenie’s limited edition range, and the first venture back into smoke since the “islay cask” limited release several years ago. some of this whisky was finished in a peated cask, some in new american oak. both influences emerge with the smoke (jerky with a hint of kippers) and spice (cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg) on a foundation of honeyed malt. spicy, smoky finish. balvenie is one of those big speyside whiskies that can stand up to the smoke. this one will not appeal to everyone, but it makes for an interesting diversion. "
"balvenie dcs compendium 1st chapter 1985 30 year old (cask 612), 54.1%",Single Malt Scotch,85,1872,"here, the distillery character is more restrained, as if it is taking a period of calm reflection before the next evolution. there’s slightly more maltiness here and the texture has changed into a light acacia honey stickiness and a development of more oxidized notes, showing a gentle maturation. it’s one i kept going back to; teasing, slightly elusive, but rewarding. £1,300"

"
"benromach port wood finish 22 year old, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,85,150,"this one stands out from the other three because of its port wood finishing. dark amber/ruby color. you’ll discover lush fruit and a rich nuttiness on top of the typical flavors expressed in the 18 year old. additional layers of intense spice and oak notes balance the whisky’s sweetness and fruit. the heartiest of the bunch.

"bowmore, 37 year old, 1968 vintage, 43.4%",Single Malt Scotch,85,1000,"every once in a while you get whisky where the palate is completely different than the nose. this is one of those whiskies. aged in bourbon casks and 37 years old, its aroma expresses tropical fruits (similar to other older bowmores), with papaya, lemon, mango, strawberry, coconut, and banana. this is balanced by vanilla, crème brûlée, honey, and just a wisp of smoke. bowmore’s islay roots are more expressive on the palate, which starts off sweet and slightly oily, quickly evolving to tropical fruit, damp oak, and then leafy smoke through to the finish. the sweetness emerges again towards the finish, with subtle brine and seaweed.

"
"whisky galore (distilled at bowmore), 16 year old, 1987 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,74,"aged in a sherry cask, and the lush fruity notes add dimension and richness without masking the whisky’s other flavors. its flavors are reminiscent of crumbled peat thrown over a campfire; damp earth, anise, and floral notes throughout, dovetailing with the lush sherried fruit. smoky, briny finish. a well-rounded dram. 
"
"bw3 elements of islay (distilled at bowmore), 51.6%",Single Malt Scotch,85,100,"this is quite a saline bowmore, but there is sufficient sliced apple, cut flowers, and fragrant smoke to give some degree of complexity to the nose. with water you get crisp oak, roasted barley, a hint of nectarine, bison grass, and wet reeds. starting lean in the mouth, it darkens slightly into brambles and a dusty smokiness before picking up a citric tang on the finish. slightly muted, but well balanced. £60/500 ml"
"bowmore 1999 px hand-bottled,  56.1%",Single Malt Scotch,85,130,"the mid-priced fèis ìle release took bowmore off into darker than usual territory. the key here was how the cask (px is, after all, as sweet a sherry as you can find) had been so well controlled. rather than being a thick, sweet mess, a balance was struck between the two elements: the cask added density and raisined fruit, while the distillery gave aromatic smoke and orange, and both combine to layer on molasses, leather, and dark chocolate. a success. £100"
"bowmore 9 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,85,37,"the latest addition to bowmore’s core range is presented at the unconventional age of 9 years. matured predominantly in oloroso sherry casks, with some bourbon cask-aged spirit thrown into the mix. the result is a whisky featuring drinking chocolate, black pepper, and soft peat on the nose. sherry and sweet peat notes merge nicely on the palate, with dates, plums, and light caramel. smoky brine in the medium-length finish. £30"
"gordon & macphail (distilled at brora), 24 year old, 1982 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,85,250,"quite fresh for 24 years old. invigorating notes of brine, spice (especially pepper and mustard seed), tropical fruit, and vanilla malt, and an appetizing, lingering brine finish. well-rounded, and a nice balance between youthful zing and maturity. my only wish is to see this bottled at a higher strength and not chill-filtered 
"
"octomore islay barley 2009, 64%",Single Malt Scotch,85,239,"an interesting nose that’s somewhat akin to a peach cheesecake with slightly burnt pastry, or a heavily caramelized crème brûlée. overt smoke is in check when neat. in the mouth, however, it comes through massively, mossy and oily and sitting on top of those fat fruits and sweet malt. thicker and more farmyard-like than port charlotte. great potential, with a sweetness that shows it’s pretty much there. £150"
"duncan taylor (distilled at bunnahabhain), 1997 vintage, 12 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,88,"more mature peated bunnahabhain islay whiskies are emerging (like this one). indeed, tarry, peat ash notes are evident throughout this one (especially on the finish!), along with nutty toffee, nougat, smoked olive, glazed ginger, and candied lime. pretty even-keeled, not as medicinal and aggressive as its cousins on the southern end of the island. the smoke and layered sweet notes balance nicely. if you’re looking to ease your way into smoky islay whiskies, this would be a good start. "
"adelphi (distilled at bunnahabhain) 1989 25 year old, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,85,265,"pale gold, with nettles and green apple on the nose alongside almond, light bread crust, and freshly-baked sponge cake. in time, there’s starburst sweets. some heat, even at this relatively low strength. there are mineral accents and, with water, the signature ginger. the palate is very sweet and soft with jelly fruits. clean and supple, especially with water. zesty, with a refreshing acidic balance."
"bunnahabhain ceobanach, 46.3%",Single Malt Scotch,85,70,"this is master blender ian macmillan’s interpretation of what bunna’ would have tasted like when the distillery was founded in 1881. there’s light smoke, coming across like smoked halibut, a mineral edge, white fruits, and a freshness like a freshly starched shirt. water brings out almond. on the palate, the smoke offers a slightly peppery, almost talisker-esque kick. light lemon and sweet fruits in the center. though there’s no age statement, none of the whiskies are under 10 years. £46"
"dun bheagan (distilled at caol ila) 1993 vintage, 10 year old, 43% abv",Single Malt Scotch,85,56,"an unusual caol ila, in that it was finished in a rum cask. the rum influence is subtle - which i like - and it offers a new dimension to the whisky without blunting that caol ila character we have come to either love or (for some of you) despise. olives, seaweed, fire smoke, salt and pepper notes are wrapped up nicely in a malty/caramel blanket. peppery, smoky finish that lingers on like the embers of an all-night bonfire. 
"
"scott's selection (distilled at caol ila), 1984 vintage, 53.5%",Single Malt Scotch,85,215,"caol ila enthusiasts will be familiar with the tarry rope, seaweed, brine, and white pepper. all this is underpinned nicely by soft, sweeter notes of dark chocolate and vanilla nut truffle. subtle underlying juniper, horehound, and mint adds intrigue. nice oily texture with a pleasing dry finish. time has tempered this caol ila, but it has aged gracefully. 
"
"signatory (distilled at caol ila), 14 year old, 1990 vintage, 56.2%",Single Malt Scotch,85,50,"light to medium in body (and quite pale in color), but quite invigorating. a flirtatious vanilla sweetness at the front of the palate quickly evolves into spicy, peppery, grassy notes. the whisky evolves further, expressing notes of smoke, tar, chewy seaweed, brine, feint green tea and olives. a persistent, if delicate, honey sweetness hangs on throughout to offer some gentility. lingering, smoky finish. a raw whisky, but somehow compelling. an excellent value too! (bottled exclusively for binny's beverage depot.)"
"gordon & macphail 'connoisseurs choice' (distilled at caol ila), 13 year old, 1991 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,70,"an interesting contrast to the signatory bottling reviewed above. while expressing a similar fundamental flavor profile, this one is a more polished affair and not as daring. it is fuller in body, nicely rounded, and expresses a sweeter foundation (less honey, more toffee and caramel). 
"
"gordon & macphail “private collection” port wood finish (distilled at caol ila), 1998 vintage, 10 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,70,"sweet, viscous, and weighty; much more so than its sister whisky (reviewed above) that was finished in madeira casks. but the same caol ila dna is here — tar, olive brine, pepper — along with fleshy red fruit and chocolate. lingering ripe fruit and tar on the finish. save this one for after dinner, or with a book at bedtime."

"clynelish 14 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,85,53,"ahh, clynelish. the enigma of the northeast coast. a single malt whose waxy character — and it does smell of snuffed candles — is highly prized by blenders. this is a palate whisky, the nose almost shy and muted: glints of citrus and jellied fruits, notes of ozone/spiciness and stem ginger. it’s on the tongue that it comes into its own: clinging, strangely savory, lightly sweet, juicily fruity. enigmatic indeed."
"murray mcdavid 'mission' (distilled at dallas dhu) 1979, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,150,"bright gold/straw color. lively aroma of honey-drenched fruit (pineapple, red currant, citrus) with a rich malty foundation. subtle floral notes in the background. medium in body, but thick, almost mouth-coating in texture (a classic dallas dhu signature). clean flavors on the palate-honey, interwoven fruit, vanilla, with a dry ""polished oak"" finish.

"signatory 'glenisla' (distilled at glen keith), cask #19600, 29 year old, 1971 vintage, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,85,300,"glenisla was an experiment by the parent company-who only owned speyside distilleries-to produce a smoky, ""islay-style"" whisky at glen keith. it is quite smoky, but without the coastal characteristics (brine, seaweed). instead, it displays notes of ripe barley, ginger, lemon peel, and licorice stick along with all that peat smoke. a rather straight-forward, uncomplicated, yet very pleasant smoky whisky. if only all the speyside distilleries did this 30 years ago.

"glenfarclas, (cask #128), 1981 vintage, 27 year old, 53.4%",Single Malt Scotch,85,200,"when i toured glenfarclas in may 2008, george grant told me that, while it is usually not their policy to stray from aging their whisky in sherry and bourbon oak casks, they have done some experimenting. one of these experiments, aged entirely in a port cask, has finally been bottled. the nice thing about glenfarclas is that it is a rich spirit and can stand up to a good dose of port wine (or sherry for that matter). the port notes are lush, with ripe fruit (plum, red grape skin, caramelized apricot, prune) and dates complementing the whisky’s malty, maple syrup foundation. the 27 years also impart a good dose of polished oak for balance. not as complex as other glenfarclas whiskies of this age, but this is certainly a solid, enjoyable change of pace for glenfarclas.

"glenrothes, 20 year old, 1984 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,85,83,"this 1984 vintage is similar in profile to its older 1972 vintage sibling (reviewed above), except that the 1972 vintage expresses greater depth and has more oak to balance the sweetness (the sherry notes get a bit sappy in this 1984 expression). the 1972 vintage also evolves more on the palate, and it is more intriguing. but don't let this keep you from trying this 1984 vintage expression. it is still a very enjoyable whisky (and more economically priced)."
"the glenrothes, 1998 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,85,55,"one thing i enjoy about these vintage releases are the differences in personality from one vintage to the next. this 1998 vintage follows shortly after the 1994, and while that one was elegant and bright in personality, this 1998 is more viscous and heavier in weight. it shows bright fruit (lemon, caramelized pineapple, tangerine), honeyed vanilla, and marzipan with a peppering of cinnamon and ginger. perhaps the 1994 as an aperitif, and the 1998 a digestif? the 1998 is not nearly as post-prandial as, say, the 1972 vintage, but it has more weight than the 1994 vintage. still, if i had to choose between the 1994 and 1998, my nod goes to the 1994 for its elegance and drinkability."

"
"douglas laing old malt cask (distilled at highland park) 15 year old, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,85,111,"unlike ‘house’ bottlings of highland park, all of which are aged in sherry casks, this expression in douglas laing’s old malt cask series has been matured in former bourbon wood. it was distilled in september 1996. sweet and fruity on the nose, with nougat and peanut butter, plus a slightly herbal note, and finally discreet, sweet peat smoke. medium-bodied, citric, and spicy, with a little smoke. smokiness turns to ash in the finish, with citrus fruit and caramel. £70"

"
"lagavulin 12 year old special release 2012, 56.1%",Single Malt Scotch,85,111,"this is usually a bracing expression of lagavulin and this year’s release doesn’t disappoint—smoldering peat, ozone freshness, but with greater sweetness than in 2011, though water shows how it is still just a little gawky. the palate is, yes, smoky, but there’s also light cereal, praline, violets, and seashore aromas aplenty. fills the mouth with intensity. okay, it’s edgy, but that’s what you expect.  "
"lagavulin 37 year old, 51%",Single Malt Scotch,85,3000,"this is a venerable lagavulin which immediately shows its age with a nose that mixes the savory (hoisin sauce) with the mature notes of dunnage warehouse, sandalwood, and a minty lift. in time, there’s bog myrtle, old attics, rain-moistened wool, and a smokiness akin to a dead briar pipe. slightly dull to start, it perks up in the mid-palate with lanolin and black olive brine, and a darjeeling-like grippiness. interesting for sure, but past its best.

"lg4 elements of islay (distilled at lagavulin), 55.7%",Single Malt Scotch,85,78,"hard not to compare this to the 12 year old, as they are of similar strength and character. this is more about the peat bank rather than the shore, more eucalyptus than kelp. this pungent, earthy note is retained with water, alongside some brine. the palate is like carrageen moss pudding, with a touch of nutmeg at the end. plenty there, but it all moves very quickly when i want it to linger. that said, a solid performer. £47/500 ml"
"lagavulin triple matured edition, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,85,135,"a very laid-back start with the sweetness of the sherry cask bringing a fat, figgy, dried fruit aroma which initially suppresses the peat, only allowing a little pipe smoke and smoked meat to emerge. with water, there’s balsam, tar, dried seaweed, and fabric band-aid. this is repeated on the tongue, with dark fruits suddenly changing to spent kiln and bonfire ashes, but there needs to be more cohesion between the elements. £80"
"lagavulin 12 year old (diageo special release 2015), 56.8%",Single Malt Scotch,85,135,"as pale as you'd expect, this year’s special release ‘limited’ bottling has a sweet, bready softness to it making it less angular than previous expressions. the smoke comes across very gently, allowing the sweet grassiness of the spirit the upper hand until water is added. the palate stirs in some emulsion paint, a pleasing lift of sulfur and anise, and gradually deepens. with water there are more smoke and marine notes."

"duncan taylor (distilled at longmorn), 29 year old, 1973 vintage, 47.6%",Single Malt Scotch,85,160,"longmorn’s signature is a thick mouth-coating, honeyed maltiness, which is almost chewy in texture. while delicious in its teens, its personality lends itself to aging, because its maltiness provides a good counterpoint to the resinous dry oak notes which are usually imparted to older whiskies. this whisky is no exception. notes of honey, vanilla malt, and subtle fruit dovetail nicely with the dry, resinous, polished leather-like contributions from 29 years in oak. nice long finish.

"mackillop’s choice (distilled at mortlach), 1989 vintage, 21 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,80,"certainly not the best mortlach i’ve tasted, but it’s a solid effort and at a good price for a 21 year old. nicely balanced — lorne mackillop’s hallmark — and somewhat reserved, too (for a mortlach), with intriguing lime, kiwi, caramel, floral notes (on the nose), nutty toffee (especially on the palate), soaked barley, and charcoal, with a rather syrupy, mouth-clinging texture toward the finish. worth a look."

"
"douglas laing old malt cask (distilled at rosebank) 21 year old, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,85,212,"the glasgow-based independent bottler douglas laing & co. ltd. has been responsible for quite a number of releases from the ‘lost’ lowland distillery of rosebank, and this one was distilled during january 1990 and bottled in april 2012. the nose is pleasingly floral and fragrant, light and gently honeyed, with a suggestion of barley in the background. the palate features spicy, sweet orange, herbs, and a slightly contrasting note of citrus fruit. spices persist into the warming, lightly-oaked finish. £135"

"
"scapa, 16 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,85,75,"a soft, easy-going whisky with a foundation of honeyed vanilla, caramel custard, and mouth-coating maltiness. floral and brine notes are sprinkled throughout, as are cocoa, white pepper, and subtle edible seaweed. soft malt and brine finish. a whisky with a gentler personality when compared to most other island malts, making it a nice introduction to the style. i would, however, like to see this whisky bottled at a higher strength and not chill-filtered. i’d be more than willing to sacrifice some drinkability for greater intensity and more subtle nuances. still, it is an enjoyable whisky, and enthusiasts of its predecessor -- scapa 14 -- should also like it, albeit at a higher retail price."

(a park avenue liquors exclusive.)

"tullibardine sherry wood finish, 1993 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,89,"this whisky starts with the light and very drinkable bourbon oak-aged 1993 vintage from previous years and then is finished off in a sherry cask. the sherry is fresh and vibrant, and adds lush fruit, light dates, and nutty undertone to tullibardine’s classic vanilla, honeyed malt, and grassy notes. delicious!

"
"tullibardine 25 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,85,250,"the oldest expression in the tullibardine lineup provides malt, cedar, stewed apples, and wood shavings on the nose. mouth-coating, with orange and cocoa powder. dries quite steadily, with oak lurking behind ripe bananas in the lengthy finish. another very accomplished old tullibardine, but the notably pleasing palate of the 20 year old just gives that bottling the edge.

satsumas—and finally, drying. £62"
"wemyss malts melon vine 1994 (distilled at aberfeldy), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,143,"this 20 year old single cask release from the perthshire distillery of aberfeldy runs to 242 bottles, matured in a hogshead. apricots, green apples, ginger, and icing sugar on the nose. soft fruits, notably peaches, gingery oak, and more icing sugar on the palate. milky coffee, caramel, and eucalyptus in the slightly oaky, medium-length finish. £90"
"wemyss malts peaches and cream 1989 (distilled at glen garioch), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,133,"this 25 year old single cask bottling of glen garioch from wemyss was one of a dozen released in late 2014. the hogshead in which maturation took place yielded 357 bottles. the nose gives apple, banana, vanilla fudge, nutmeg, and soft spices. creamy and nutty on the palate, with a squeeze of lemon, soft toffee, and milk chocolate. the finish is medium in length, spicy and nutty, with cocoa powder and just a suggestion of smoke. £87"
"wemyss malts summer fruit cup 1998 (distilled at auchentoshan), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,107,"this is the lowlander among wemyss malts’ dozen single cask releases for the fall of 2014. maturation took place in a bourbon barrel, which yielded 295 bottles. tinned peaches in syrup, caramel, mild vanilla, and damp tweed on the nose. medium-bodied and intensely fruity on the palate, with apricots, raspberries, and ginger. fruit notes linger in the finish, with spicy milk chocolate. £70"
"wemyss malts toffee tuile (distilled at aberfeldy) 1999, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,129,"following on from another 1999 single cask aberfeldy in the previous batch of wemyss malts’ releases, we have toffee tuile, matured in a hogshead. the nose is sweet and approachable, with tinned fruit cocktail, vanilla, malt, and fresh ginger. tropical fruit, brittle toffee, hazelnuts, a hint of caramel, and more ginger on the nose. the finish is medium in length, fruity, and mildly spicy. (393 bottles) £88"
"wemyss the hive 12 year old, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,85,57,"wemyss has picked up where the easy drinking whisky company left off a few years back and are selling their mix of malt whiskies under a descriptive flavor name. this is the best the company has done so far. it is a delightfully soft, fruity, and dessert-like whisky with, yes, lashings of honeyed malt to make it a soft, succulent treat of a whisky. wemyss comes of age.  £36"
"wemyss malts the hive, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,85,54,"having previously appeared in 8 and 12 year old versions, wemyss dropped the age statement from their easygoing honey-drenched dram. fortunately, the nose of light honey, lavender, heather, and spring blossoms confirms that it’s business as usual. melon, mango, passion fruit, and a deft touch of spice give this a sweet, fruity profile. gentle heat persists into the finish with honeyed sweetness. it’s crying out for a perfect scoop of vanilla ice cream. still a crowd pleaser. £37"
"port askaig, 25 year old, 45.8%",Single Malt Scotch,85,122,"still in the same vein as its 17 year old sibling reviewed above, but it’s softer, mellower, with more wood impact (especially on the nose and back end of the palate) and tea leaves. perhaps even some mild tobacco. darker sugars in this one (molasses?) rather than honey, and more berried fruit along with the citrus, which struggles to reveal itself. dry, resinous finish. an enjoyable dram, even if the wood outstays its welcome. but if you have to pick between the two expressions, go for the 17 year old and pocket the change with a smile on your face. price: £75"
"kilchoman (summer 2010 release), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,70,"this young distillery’s fourth release, aged entirely in bourbon barrels. (this is the first one available in the u.s.) the two previous releases that i tasted and reviewed (the inaugural release and the autumn 2009 release) were finished in sherry casks. i miss the sherry, to be honest. i think it softened the whisky, added a new dimension, and perhaps even masked some of the youth. still, this is a very nice effort: brisk, vibrant, and bracing, with plenty of raw peat smoke and tar, along with pear, citrus, vanilla, licorice root, bourbon barrel char, clove, bitter chocolate, and suggestions of olive brine and high-end mescal."
"kilchoman loch gorm 2016 (distilled 2010), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,100,"the annual (albeit limited) loch gorm release allows you to chart kilchoman’s development in sherry casks. here, first-fill and refill sherry casks (oloroso to be precise) were used. the latter seem to have more of a say, as the distillery character is more apparent: sweet fruit, marine smoke, and clementine, before the golden raisin from the cask develops. the palate is smokier and also more overtly sherried. a bolder style, but very well balanced. limited, so get in there asap."
"douglas laing director’s cut (distilled at teaninich) 1982, 47.8%",Single Malt Scotch,85,297,"this 30 year old bottling from teaninich was distilled in december 1982 and matured in a refill butt. just 201 bottles have been released from cask #9323. the nose is characterized by lemon curd, flat coca-cola, and spicy malt. the palate is smooth, sweet and fruity, with vanilla and stem ginger. autumn berries and more ginger figure in the lengthy, slightly charred finish. £195"
"glen moray elgin classic port cask finish, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,85,30,"this is finished for 8 months in tawny port pipes and is quite restrained on the early nose, opening up to reveal rose petals, milk chocolate, and double cream.  the palate is floral, with raisins  and red currants. drying in the  finish, with peppery oak and  cinnamon."
"cadenhead’s (distilled at	 auchroisk) 12 year old, 59.3%",Single Malt Scotch,85,92,"pale, with fresh perfumed/fragrant estery notes that touch on flower blossom, almond icing on a custard cake, and even a little candy floss. all very aromatically intense, with quite a hot focus on the tongue. with water you keep the concentration and add in lemon, jellied fruits, and light, dusty spiciness."
"auchroisk 25 year old, 51.2%",Single Malt Scotch,85,450,"distilled in 1990, this rare expression was matured in refill american oak hogsheads. quite shy on the nose, even at cask strength. ultimately, faintly floral notes, with pear drops, vanilla, and linseed. very smooth on the palate, with soft fruity malt, vanilla, peach, and dark berries. buttery mango and nutmeg in the finish. diageo special releases 2016. (3,954 bottles)"
"inverleven, chivas brothers, deoch an doras bottling, 36 year old, 48.5%",Single Malt Scotch,85,450,"this veteran lowland inverleven — distilled within the now decommissioned dumbarton grain distillery complex — is a recent addition to chivas brothers’ cask strength edition series, and is exclusively available at distillery visitor centers and from www.maltwhiskydistilleries.com. the nose is creamy, gentle, and sweet, with vanilla, rum raisin ice cream, and a subtle, contrasting peppery note. mouth-coating, with citrus fruits and slowly developing dark chocolate, which lingers through the long and gingery finish. (500 bottles). currently not available in the u.s. £275 "
"speyburn 10 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,85,25,"okay, how many of you have walked past this one thinking the price is just too crazily low for the liquid to be any good? how many have started your whisky life with this and then set it aside? time to rethink. speyburn, one of the forgotten distilleries of rothes, is a charmer. sweet and fragrant with notes of blossom and a little red fruit on the nose, the palate shows ginger, cream, and rhubarb. (value pick)"
"master of malt reference series iii, 47.5%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,85,178,"with the majority of the blend coming from older single malts, this forms a counterpoint to i and ii (see below). toasted spices, fennel, black peppercorns, cocoa, malt loaf, split orange peels, and salted caramel invade the nose. the palate is a gluttony of chocolate. beneath, look for dried fruits, macchiato, peanut shells, and some tannic bitterness as the older malts show their wares. it leaves a cocoa finish without the sweetness. a great concept for self-educating your palate. £106"
"that boutique-y springbank batch 2, 53.10%",Single Malt Scotch,85,89,"that boutique-y whisky company is an independent bottler noted for quirky and very contemporary label design. the whiskies carry no age statements. springbank batch 2 has an outturn of 450 numbered bottles. initially, overripe pineapples and dry hay on the oily nose, cut by a sprinkling of salt. brittle toffee, and finally, hand-rolling tobacco. the palate is very fruity; more pineapple, plus peach, developing peat, plenty of spice, and more tobacco. the finish is relatively long and slightly herbal. £58"
"that boutique-y whisky company (distilled at macallan) 30 year old, 46.5%",Single Malt Scotch,85,604,"ebony colored whisky with dark aromas of dense fruitcake, fresh fig, medjool dates, sultana, and christmas spices of nutmeg, clove, and cinnamon, though a struck-match note lurks within. the treacle-thick palate has coca-cola, clove, aniseed, eucalyptus, sultanas, leather, blackcurrant, black cherry, dried fig, and raisin. the currant-bun finish is tannic and woody; tastebuds flinch and recoil. this is a grizzled old-timer best left to adventurous souls."
"that boutique-y whisky company blended malt, 54%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,85,76,"have you ever noticed how some distilleries never appear under independent labels? they say they put a teaspoon of whisky from another distillery in each barrel; no longer a single malt. whether they really do, who knows? so here is a blended malt with 99.99 percent of the whisky from one distillery. this has no peat and is sweet, honeyed, and rich, with vanilla, banana, lime sherbet, and tropical fruits. almost certainly from speyside…but where? £50"
"that boutique-y whisky company (distilled at cambus) 24 year old, 49.7%",Grain Scotch Whisky,85,62,"nearly a quarter of a century since cambus distillery closed, select casks are still being bottled by the independents. grapefruit peel, fruit teas, lemon zest, mixed spice, cardamom, and wild garlic make for an intriguing nose. a sweet taste of sugared almonds, lemon bonbons, strands of candied peel, bananas, and vanilla, before the spices stomp all over the sweetness. hot, dry, spicy finish with just a lick of butterscotch."
"shieldaig 12 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,31,"this is a sharp dresser, with a firm, solid mouthfeel and an altogether finer and more focused taste than shieldaig classic (see
below). it’s not coastal or earthy particularly, either. instead the flavors are softer and built around mocha, smooth creamy toffee, and some soft fruit, including a touch of overripe banana and melon notes. the savoriness this time comes from a touch of pepper rather than salt."
"james brookes blended whisky, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,18,"this is like listening to a quiet and understated musician and slowly starting to realize that there are all sorts of clever
nuances just beneath the surface. this evolves from a floral and welcoming nose, through a saline note and on to pepper and a highland earthiness, but wrapped up in a rich, honeyed body. a nice balance between the ruggedness and sweet softness. all rather pleasant."
"sir edward’s smoky, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,22,"this blend delivers just enough peat turf to live up to the name, without alienating the peat phobics. a pleasant nose of chocolate hazelnut, pecan nut, dried tropical fruits, and gentle wood and peat smoke.  orange, toffee, banoffee pie, kola kubes, and a little spiciness. plenty of flavor even if the mouthfeel is a little thin. a short finish with a spicy flare and a few lingering smoky embers. (total wine exclusive) price per 1.75 liter"
"douglas laing old particular (distilled at dalmore) 17 year old cask #0080, 54.8%",Single Malt Scotch,85,152,"this dalmore single cask variant was distilled in october 1996 and filled into a refill hogshead, which yielded 139 bottles in january 2014. freshly-mown hay, then marzipan and nectarines on the well-spiced nose. nutty caramel in time. the palate features terry’s chocolate orange, vanilla, and nutmeg. citrus fruits and malt in the finish, with hazelnuts and a hint of oak. £90"
"douglas laing provenance (distilled at dailuaine) 10 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,66,"dailuaine is a fascinating distillery and this has a fascinating nose, as it shows a heavy sulfury new make entering maturity and starting to pick up extra weight from the cask. there’s a glimpse of sweetness, a little fruit, but the dominant character is a savory meatiness (beef stock cubes). the palate shows dried mint and masses of this meaty/sweet interplay. is it commercial? probably not, but it tells a really important story. i like it a lot. £45"
"the exclusive malts (distilled at auchroisk) 11 year old 2003 (cask #9), 56.4%",Single Malt Scotch,85,110,"most of auchroisk's malt goes into diageo’s j&b blended, so a single malt release is an uncommon treat. aged in refill sherry casks, this whisky has a nutty, roasted malt nose. on the palate it’s soft and lush, with honeyed roasted malt, walnut, ginger, and salt. a spicy mid-palate leads to a dry finish that abandons a lot of the flavors established. a solid mix of flavors, but the finish shows why it's often used for blending. (u.s. only)"
"signatory (distilled at cameronbridge) 1995, 43%",Single Grain Whisky,85,44,"a pale grain from the colossal fife distillery, released at 18 years old as part of signatory’s vintage single grain collection. vanilla icing, digestive biscuits, pumpernickel, toasted coconut flakes, crushed cumin seed, and a background note of fresh mint are apparent. the vanilla and blossom honey flavors are in union with the buttery, lightweight texture, and there’s a pulsating spiciness that lives on in the finish. a refreshing alternative. £26"
"gordon & macphail 8 year old (distilled at pulteney), 40%",Single Malt Scotch,85,45,"offered in the ‘distillery labels’ series by gordon & macphail, this expression from wick’s pulteney distillery hearkens back to the era when gordon & macphail was its principal bottler, and 8 its standard age. aged in refill bourbon barrels. soft fruits, dried grass, and faint wood smoke on the nose. smooth and nutty on the palate, with smoky spice, a sprinkling of salt, and ripe pears. the finish is medium in length, mildly peppered, nutty, and oaky."
"gordon & macphail connoisseurs choice 1997 (distilled at tomatin), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,85,92,"matured in refill bourbon barrels, this tomatin is softly floral on the nose, with sweet fruit spices, pineapple, vanilla, and honey. the palate is fresh and fruity, with cream, milk chocolate, and nutty spice. fruity to the end, notably ripe apples and red berries, plus more milk chocolate before slightly drying oak notes develop. £70"
"glen deveron 20 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,85,152,"the nose is more reticent than that of its younger sibling, with less spice and succulent fruitiness. a hint of nougat, but overall, drier and ‘quieter.’ the palate is silky, with walnuts and allspice, while fruit notes are provided by plums. following the overall theme here, the finish is also drier than that of the 16 year old variant, featuring a sprinkling of spicy cocoa powder. relatively lengthy. exclusively available to travelers at world duty free group stores in selected airports throughout the uk and spain. £90/liter"
"the lost distilleries blend (batch 6), 49.3%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,512,"the sixth incarnation of master of malt’s cult blend of closed distillery whiskies contains port ellen, brora, mosstowie, glenisla, imperial, caperdonich, and glen mhor with grain whisky from port dundas. apples and sugar browning in a pan, smooth driftwood, and dairy fudge, but with the glenisla it’s noticeably smokier than earlier batches. sweet blancmange initially, before it soars to a tangy, spicy peak; the peat smoke backed by white pepper, ground ginger, peanuts, and florentines. smokin’ liquid history. (534 bottles) £350"
"aultmore 12 year old, 55%",Single Malt Scotch,85,53,"aultmore is normally light and estery, and this pale dram is true to this. after a whiff of fresh turmeric, there’s an almost oily green note with william pear before acetone, and something akin to school bunsen burners (a good smell) emerges. the palate is more coherent than the nose; sweet, rounded, and more substantial that you expect, with tinned pears in custard. lively and charming; shows none of the firmness of youth suggested by the nose."
"duncan taylor (distilled at aultmore) 6 year old, 53.2%",Single Malt Scotch,85,85,"remarkably rich color, indicative of a first-fill cask. a clean if hot nose with carpenter’s workbench, comice pear, and lots of oak. aultmore’s acidity comes through on the palate, with its zingy intensity cutting through the wood and achieving a certain balance. the palate shows a mix of fruit and wood sugars. young certainly, but bottled at the right time given the intensity of the wood element. water makes it more sappy and summery. not hugely complex, but fun."
"the sovereign (distilled at north british) 25 year old, 57.5%",Single Grain Whisky,85,80,"green grapes, fresh apple, caramel, wood spices, cinnamon, nutmeg, and digestive biscuits show the freshness of this quarter-century dram. before the alcohol grips, sweet corn flavors and acidic-citrus fruitiness present themselves (a north british characteristic). a pleasurable, thick-textured taste of cookie dough, lime, lemon, orange jell-o, and oak spices. a sparkling citrus finish dances on the tip of the tongue. water discharges the taste of artificial sweeteners, so buck up and take it as it comes. (k&l wines exclusive)"
"darkness! (distilled at north british) 18 year old, 50.4%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,85,111,"this north british has been led astray; well, subjected to three months’ confinement in first-fill oloroso sherry wood. such are the ways of darkness! there’s a savory nose of peppered filet, mustard seed, and tarragon. interesting, but not to everyone’s taste. the creamy texture consists of evaporated milk, strong caramel, dark toffee, and black currant granola, though that savory character persists. water pumps up the cream, raspberry, and cereal notes until it sees daylight, becoming almost a breakfast whisky. £70"
"the lost distillery company gerston (batch 2/1), 46%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,65,"a pale primrose of a dram. waxed lemon, salted butter pats, white peach, honey, and the wood smoke from green stems. a sip brings highland toffee, honey, chocolate fudge, rich tart fruits, with dried apple, raisin, mixed peel, and a late appearance of malt, pepper, and smoke. it wraps up with a glossy, clingy finish, but it’s short. experimenting with water nudges peanut brittle, pralines, and fudge to the surface. overall, a very decent drop."
"cadenhead’s (distilled at bunnahabhain) 2005, 57.2%",Single Malt Scotch,85,110,"initially very ozonic, fresh, and marine. so much so that you don’t notice the smoke which is slowly building. everything is very restrained, some cold-smoked fish, mineral, and—in time—a hint of the mash tun. that mineral note continues on the palate, which broadens into ginger nuts in the middle of the tongue. all very well-balanced, and at its best neat."
"duncan taylor octave (distilled at glen grant) 1995, 47.7%",Single Malt Scotch,85,151,"the impact given by secondary maturation in small (octave) sherry casks is what sets this range apart. here, glen grant’s light fruits are given a darker twist, with some bodega notes, blackberry, and a surprising note of curry spices before milk chocolate develops; this is particularly apparent on the palate. the palate is gentle and quite creamy (cream sherry?) but it doesn’t like water. a pleasing dram. £99"
"duncan taylor 18 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,70,"a toasty and spicier interpretation of an 18 year old blend. toffee, salted pecans, dundee cake, and sultana aromas. a beautiful, thick texture replete with ripe red fruits, cardamom, fennel, and star anise. caramels drift past on a river of spice, wreathed in a fine layer of smoke, then oak, mixed nuts, and cracker bread. the fruity sweetness is momentary and fleeting, leaving the front of the mouth loaded with spice."
"duncan taylor five star, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,17,"it begins innocently enough. ripening strawberries, cotton candy, and fudge on the nose, but with an undertow of devil-may-care spiciness. soft mandarin citrus, vanilla fudge, sponge cupcakes, and a decent wedge of malt form the core of the palate; the spice is disappointingly mild considering the potential of the first sniff. sweet and syrupy finish. still, solid enough to make your world better at the end of a hard day."
"pittyvaich 1989 25 year old (diageo special release 2015), 49.9%",Single Malt Scotch,85,400,"good to see pittyvaich back in the special release roster. here we have the heavy, nutty character of the distillery given full expression. the emphasis here is on a mix of nuts, cake mix, and dense fruits: even a little hint of cigarette tobacco. when neat, the palate has real density that is enlivened by water, which brings out fresher—and decidedly more green—notes. worth a dram."
"usquaebach 15 year old, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,80,"the blended malt in the series is drawn from select aged highland single malt whiskies chosen by stewart laing. a luxuriant nose of rich, runny caramels, deliciously malty, and balanced with notes of dried apple, mixed peel, and pecan shells layered over warm spice. smooth, with a light to medium body showing toffee apple, raisin, and caramel, tasting fatter with time and yielding pineapple notes. a finish of soft, sucked toffees and tingly spices. a top-class, well-executed drink."
"kininvie 23 year old (batch 3), 42.6%",Single Malt Scotch,85,173,"as if making up for lost time, wee bottles of kininvie are popping out every month. this is a fine demonstration of the distillery style which sits—appropriately enough—between the lightness of glenfiddich and the fruity sweetness of balvenie. here, flowers are to the fore, along with creme anglaise, and a light herbal edge. there’s some weight to the palate, but very little oakiness. a perfumed finish akin to elderflower maintains the frothy floral aspect. a perfect spring dram. £120"
"bruichladdich octomore 7.2, 58.5%",Single Malt Scotch,85,191,"also distilled in 2009, this is mid-gold in color and medium weight, with a mass of sage-like smoke. more cask influence than 7.1, with smoked coconut, and again a mix of sweet fruits and lemon behind this smoky lead. oily and rich, but a little fragmented on the tongue; the elements are beginning to cohere to produce integrated complexity. octomore in mellow mood, with smoked chestnut and a little farmyardy pinot note. another positive work in progress report. £125"
"buchanan’s deluxe 12 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,30,"overlook the fact that this bottle is saddled with one of the most impenetrable closures known to mankind. unperturbed, this blend flaunts its big toffee aromas, whole almond, and floral top notes. with light fudge and gentle orange influences, it is smooth and rounded, top loaded with spice and hazelnut at the front of the mouth. more grain character and roasted spices show through on the finish."
"buchanan’s master, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,45,"this adheres to the rules laid down by blender keith law. the nose yields mint toffees, cereal notes, butterscotch, and whole peppercorn. juicy orange, with elements of burnt orange, dark toffees, and a pleasant balance of sweetness form the palate, followed by a wave of peppery spices and late dashes of dates and sultana. the finish has more peppery spice and peppermint. obey the law."
"j&b rare, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,85,23,"justerini & brooks sold scotch in the u.s. before prohibition. this light, speyside-style blend has grassy notes, with crystalized lemon slices, bramley apple peel, woodsmoke, and almonds. light and sweet on the tongue, it unpacks lemon peel, satsuma, juicy watermelon, pepper, and aniseed. grain whisky and herbal notes creep in late and permeate the finish."
"cardhu 18 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,84,101,"cardhu—for me, at least—means intensity, and this delivers precisely that, with masses of
citrus (bergamot and grapefruit) and just a hint of dark chocolate behind. with
water, there’s red apple and victoria plum, while the mouth is precise, with
any richness cut with fresh acidity. zesty and fresh on the finish. try it in a
bobby burns. released without any fanfare, here’s evidence that cardhu’s
rebuilding its reputation nicely. £66"
"compass box 'the spice tree', 46%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,65,"the second generation of the spice tree. (this new expression sports a much larger tree image on the front label.) while the first bottling used inner french oak staves to impart additional oak influence, this one uses french oak barrel heads. this new bottling is also bolder, displaying more oak -- there are more dried spice notes and it’s more viscous and clinging on the palate. (it’s also less elegant than the original bottling.) notes of sticky toffee, vanilla fudge, bramble, and red currant give way to oak resin, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, and subtle lemongrass. a tactile, somewhat resinous, polished leather finish wraps it up. a nice whisky, but i really enjoy the subtler, more elegant nature of the original bottling better."
"johnnie walker red label, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,25,"how does this long-established blend shape up on its own without a ginger or soda mixer? fresh apple juice, a twist of lemon, dried orange peel, peppercorn, cracker bread, and a vegetal spicy note. it gets into its stride with delicious apple, gentle fudge, and good-tempered spices, with cracked black pepper and a little sourness to finish. mild, agreeably smooth, without any bombast or hullabaloo; it just blends in."
"aberlour 12 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,45,"double cask matured. fruitier, sweeter, and more straightforward than the new 16 year old. ripe tangerine, orchard fruit, and caramel apples, all on a bed of nutty toffee. underlying notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger, with a dusting of dark chocolate. after the sweetness fades away, there’s lingering spice and oak resin on the finish. a good alternative to macallan 12 year old or glenfarclas 12 year old."
"aberlour 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,84,44,"somehow this 12 year old—a mix of sherry and american oak—is overlooked by malt lovers heading straight to the mental world of a’bunadh. this is aberlour at a crucial point in its growth: you’ve lost the maltiness of the 10 year old, but there’s none of the heavy toffee and licorice of a’bunadh or older expressions. here it’s sweet fruits in charge: red apple, black currant, plum. the sherry has added depth, the american oak honey. length and balance. "
"aberlour a’bunadh (batch 50), 59.6%",Single Malt Scotch,84,80,"very sweet, with thick hard toffee, stewing dates and figs, molasses, and rum raisin ice cream, before some dark chocolate, dried mint, and orange peel. the palate is a different beast. it ignites on the tongue with a burst of dried pepper flakes, beneath which are cocktail bitters: gentian calamus. it begs for water, when out comes black currant jam (very aberlour) and a little malt. now it’s calm and hugely drinkable, and therefore even more dangerous."
"aberfeldy 16 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,84,90,"aberfeldy distillery has added a 16 year old expression to its core range, positioned between the existing 12 and 21 year old variants. this newcomer has been finished in oloroso sherry casks, and the result is a pleasing if undemanding dram with a fresh, sweet, sherried nose, featuring orange, honey, and ginger. smooth on the palate, with more oranges, marzipan, then milk chocolate and gentle spices. nutty spice, increasingly bitter orange, and dark chocolate in the finish. £62"
"ardbeg auriverdes, 49.9%",Single Malt Scotch,84,100,"this year’s ardbeg day bottling is named in tribute to world cup host brazil’s national colors: auri (gold) and verdes (green). very restrained to start: grassy, sweet with vanilla pod, shoreline, and smoke wrapped in a woolen blanket. the palate shows more smoke, light chocolate, ardbeg oiliness, and soot. it’s fresh and charming, but ultimately is a quarterfinalist beaten on penalties."
"arran 12 year old cask strength, 53.6%",Single Malt Scotch,84,70,"this is the second batch of arran 12 year old in cask strength format, and it contains a higher percentage of sherry cask-matured whisky than the first. the out-turn is just over 13,000 bottles. fresh and sweet on the nose after an initial note of resin, with oats and hot butter. full-bodied, syrupy and sweet on the palate, with apricots, ripe bananas, nutmeg, and walnuts. the finish majors in plain chocolate, maraschino cherries, and a suggestion of smoky sherry. "
"arran machrie moor cask strength (batch 1), 58.4%",Single Malt Scotch,84,78,"arran first introduced its peated machrie moor variant some five years ago; since then it has become a firm favorite. late 2014 saw the appearance of the first cask strength edition of machrie moor, limited to 6,000 bottles. wood smoke, warm tar, and emerging new leather on the bold nose. sweet peat and spices on the palate, barbecue sauce, and black pepper. long in the finish: vanilla, with sweet smoke and chili."
"gordon & macphail (distilled at arran) 2006, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,45,"bottled in 2015, this expression from arran distillery was matured in first-fill bourbon barrels. ripe apple and tinned peaches on the early nose, icing sugar, a hint of mint, and soft toffee. lively spices and pear drops on the palate, with vanilla and cocoa. the finish is medium in length, with a twist of lemon and cocoa powder."
"auchentoshan, 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,84,45,"similar to the classic in its tropical fruit and honeyed vanilla, but with more depth, emerging nuts, and dried spice. thicker too—with a slightly oily texture. a noticeable improvement from the classic. this 12 year old is worth the few extra bucks. it’s the most rounded and balanced of the three new whiskies."
"auchentoshan 1999 bordeaux cask matured, 58%",Single Malt Scotch,84,70,"the 11 year old triple distilled lowland single malt in this bottling has been matured entirely in french oak casks that previously contained bordeaux wine, then bottled at cask strength. the nose offers contrasting sweet and sour fruit notes, red grapes and gooseberries, damp newspaper, warm stone, and vanilla. herbal, with cloves and spearmint. mouth-coating, bittersweet on the palate, with molasses and — inevitably — red wine. dark chocolate, raisins, and aniseed in the drying finish. "
"duncan taylor (distilled at auchentoshan) 13 year old 1998, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,66,"another recent addition to aberdeenshire bottler duncan taylor’s dimensions range, launched late last year. the nose is very fruity, with sliced peaches and apricots, plus a porridge-like background note. relatively full bodied and malty, with intense fruit notes, then dark spices appear. the finish is medium in length, spicy with aniseed balls, then a lingering creaminess at the very end. £42"
"auchentoshan virgin oak, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,70,"morrison bowmore distillers has recently released a virgin oak-matured expression of its auchentoshan single malt, which has no age statement. the north american oak casks have been charred prior to receiving this lowland whisky as their first fillings. the result is a nose of madeira, cinnamon, vanilla, and white pepper. very spicy on the palate, with citrus fruits and plain chocolate. lingering in the finish, with cocoa powder, icing sugar; becoming slightly more bitter with time."
"balblair 16 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,84,50,"light to medium in body, but quite flavorful. firm spice notes and subtle brine (both of which are often found in northern highland malts) makes the whisky fresh and quite lively. there’s a soothing, mouth-coating, toffee sweetness providing balance and depth. this is the first distillery bottling of balblair available here in the u.s. in a long time, and it is very welcomed. 
"
"balblair 1989 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,94,"the third and final release of the 1989 vintage of northern highland malt balblair is on sale in europe initially, with u.s. availability (at approximately $95) this fall. initially quite reticent on the nose, with a hint of potato chips, mild vanilla, lemon, and unripe bananas. full and rounded on the palate; nutty, with tropical fruits and lively spice. medium length in the finish, with apricots, instant coffee, and milky cocoa.  £60"
"balblair 2002 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,63,"this 2002 expression of balblair replaces the previous 2001 vintage as the ‘entry level’ bottling. it is naturally colored and non-chill filtered, in line with the rest of the balblair range, and has been matured in bourbon barrels. fizzy lemonade, banana skins, and violets on the nose, with soft caramel developing in time. fruit and nut milk chocolate on the palate, with ripe apples and vanilla. long, floral, and lively in the finish. £40"
"balblair 1996 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,80,"balblair’s 1996 vintage expression replaces the previous 1995 variant as a travel retail-exclusive bottling, and maturation has taken place in bourbon casks. ginger snaps, peaches, pineapple, and vanilla on the relatively light, fresh nose, which also has just a wisp of smoke in the background. medium-bodied, the palate offers soft toffee, milk chocolate, spices, and the same fruit notes as the nose. the finish is quite lengthy, with a final flourish of black pepper. price is per one liter."
"balvenie single barrel sherry cask 15 year old, 47.8%",Single Malt Scotch,84,100,"big sherry influence immediately, with walnut skin, raisin bread, and mixed peels. seems pretty dry, and the malty undertow here is whole grain bread. balvenie’s signature sweetness comes across like soft brown demerara sugar before it shifts into forest floor, mulch, nut, and dried berries. just enough residual sweetness to keep the tannins at bay. water makes it more woody, with burlap, cacao, a little earthiness, and a slightly bitter exit."
"balvenie dcs compendium 1st chapter 1997 17 year old (cask 5365), 60.7%",Single Malt Scotch,84,1008,"the mix of honey, citrus, fruit, and malt which sits at balvenie’s core is beginning to deepen. the citrus fruits, for example, are becoming concentrated, the honey is set clover, the fruits moving into cooked apricot and banana. rounded and thick in the mouth, where the honeyed aspects and fleshiness of the fruits take control, before a bloom of bridal bouquet. tremendously complex, here’s balvenie's flowering into mid-period maturity. the price is…scary! £700"
"the benriach herodotus, 12 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,85,"finished in a pedro ximinez cask. this is the sweetest and most tactile of the three whiskies. peat smoke married with lush notes of sultana, ripe peaches, pineapple, white chocolate, shortbread, and thick honey. delicate floral notes (heather, lavender) add finesse. i expected a darker personality with the sherry finish. i was pleasantly surprised. 
"
"benriach, 30 year old, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,84,450,"deeper and darker in character than the benriach 25 year old also reviewed here, with more sherry character. chewy toffee, nougat, and rum infused with raisin provide the foundation of this whisky. background notes of cinnamon, baker’s chocolate, and a suggestion of wet leather and old parchment add intrigue. 
"
"benriach, 12 year old, 1994 vintage, 59.5%",Single Malt Scotch,84,54,"a peated version of benriach that was also finished in a port pipe. there is a really nice blend of flavors here; a sweet malty foundation layered with ripe red fruit notes (raspberry, strawberry preserve, currant) and a firm blanket of smoke that goes on and on. all the flavors are bold, but they’re equally balanced. not a subtle whisky but quite entertaining. (a binny’s beverage depot exclusive.) 
"
"benriach peated quarter casks, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,81,"this peated expression was matured in quarter casks and is the first bottling to be launched since benriach was acquired by brown-forman in april 2016. the nose offers sweet peat and new leather, coal, and a hint of iodine. white pepper and big peat notes on the palate. ripe apples develop and spices spread around the mouth. the finish is medium in length, warming, and gently smoky. £65"
"master of malt darkness! benrinnes 15 year old oloroso cask finish, 52.9%",Single Malt Scotch,84,101,"what you look for in a finished whisky is for some of the distillery's character to be apparent, but also enhanced. benrinnes is a big, meaty dram, which suits sherry and its feral aspect is there. think of roast beef with damson jam, date, and blackberry. the palate is thick with licorice sweetness and a bitter edge. it has power, and while you can see the join between original spirit and finish, it’s a pretty happy match. £60/500 ml"
"benrinnes 21 year old (diageo special release 2014), 56.9%",Single Malt Scotch,84,400,"meaty, beaty, big, but only slightly bouncy. the nose is initially reminiscent of curried mutton with an added heathery earthiness and some distillery sulfur. it then dries into biltong/pemmican with some faint barley notes behind. the water adds a note of fresh coriander. massive in the mouth, with raisin, roasting tins. it’s a relief when water releases some surprisingly soft treacle toffee sweetness, but it’s not quite enough to balance the massive meaty assault. (2,892 bottles)"
"benromach, 25 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,125,"the oldest of the group, and it shows. when compared to younger expressions, there’s less peaches and more citrus (lemon, tangerine). it is thicker on the palate-with notes of fat barley and crème brulee-before dry, resinous oak notes intensify. dry, spicy finish. not as even-keeled as younger expressions, but quite dynamic. 
"
"benromach origins 12 year old, batch 2, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,84,80,"the newest member of the ever-expanding range hailing from gordon & macphail’s own distillery in forres. this example has been aged in port pipes — and it shows immediately on the nose. benromach is a teasing mid-weight speysider, and this has added depth of sweet damson jam-like aromas mixed with seville orange (marmalade) and some milky nut. rich fruitcake flavors on the tongue. this is a very well balanced and precocious 12 year old. worth a look. "
"benromach hermitage 2007, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,84,53,"initially matured in bourbon barrels for 6 years, the spirit was then aged for a further 31 months in wine casks from the hermitage appellation d’origine contrôlée. soft on the nose, with fresh red berries, oiled leather, cinnamon, and a hint of smoke. rich, slightly smoky cherry and berry notes on the palate, plus milk chocolate and lively spices. initially fruity, then drying in the finish with wood smoke and light tannins."
"cadenhead's, (distilled at blair athol), 1989, 58.1%",Single Malt Scotch,84,90,"pale gold color. aromas reminiscent of a holiday spice cake-ginger, cinnamon, honey, and a touch of citrus fruit. medium bodied, but it coats the palate-there's some viscosity here. the flavors are rather soothing and very much like its aroma, with a malty sweetness throughout and a lingering finish.
   style: highland single malt scotch whisky. price: high $80s. limited availability. 
   the owners of blair athol have chosen not to export this whisky to the u.s. for this reason it can be rather difficult to find, only occasionally being imported by one of the independent bottlers. this particular expression is a very good example from this distillery."
"blair athol, 55.8%",Single Malt Scotch,84,100,"this distillery-only bottling strips away the sweet gloopiness of the standard 12 year old — and is all the better for that. the nose is soft and gentle, with rose petals and rose hips over a base of ripe plum and a touch of ginger cake. the palate is intriguing and holds the attention, with citrus fruits, bitter apple, spice, and a touch of peppermint. it is all very clean, sophisticated, and pleasant. the finish is long and warming, and the overall experience is highly enjoyable. justified as a distillery-only bottling? without a doubt. "
"duncan taylor (distilled at blair athol) 22 year old 1989, 50.5%",Single Malt Scotch,84,125,"new to duncan taylor’s dimensions range is this single cask (#2927), cask strength offering from perthshire’s blair athol distillery. sweet and fruity on the nose, majoring in tinned pineapple in syrup. toffee, nougat, and a hint of freshly-dug soil make up the supporting aromatic cast. full bodied and initially as sweet in the mouth as it was on the nose, with vigorous spices, particularly nutmeg, then it begins to dry. the long finish is characterized by powdery cocoa and oak tannins. £80"
"hart brothers (distilled at bowmore) 11 year old, 55.5%",Single Malt Scotch,84,78,"there have been some legendary hart brothers bottlings of bowmore (the 1966 bottled in ’74 is a classic) so this has a lot to live up to. the nose is creamy and discreet, but bowmore is less about charging out wreathed in smoke and more a dram where peat is part of the totality. here you get seashells and low-tide aromas, along with green banana. the palate is gently smoked with light barley, cool melon. an afternoon dram. £50"
"bowmore the devil’s casks iii, 56.7%",Single Malt Scotch,84,274,"sadly, the final chapter in a series which deservedly acquired cult status because of the way it showed how well bowmore behaved in close proximity to sherry casks. this was aged in oloroso and px and has a thick, dark nose, all dried black fruits and saddlebags. the smoke is sotto voce. the savory nature continues on the palate. it needs water to bring out fresh fruits, and while there’s a bitterness on the end, that’s a minor cavil. £190"
"bowmore fèis ìle 2016, 54.9%",Single Malt Scotch,84,71,"this vatting of three virgin oak casks and one oloroso butt was so keenly priced that it sold out in seconds, all 1,500 bottles of it. it shows bowmore, that ever-changing, elusive islay dram in perfumed, scented mode. i picked up vetiver (an integral part of classic male cologne), but also peach, some flamed peels, and plenty of smoke. the palate dips into the sea for a second, then again becomes scented, alongside gentle chocolate. amazing price too. £55"
"bruichladdich wmd ii, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,75,"aged in bourbon casks and then enhanced in rioja wine casks. a mélange of red berry fruits, firm malt, thick vanilla and spicy oak, along with a hint of grape skin, anise, and orange peel. gritty, dry finish. 
"
"bruichladdich links, 14 year old, 46% abv",Single Malt Scotch,84,75,"aged in refill sherry casks. one taste bears this out with its dominant honeyed fruit foundation (lemons, melons, pineapple). still, that bruichladdich freshness and appetizing ""sea breeze"" character dovetails nicely. fuller, more rounded, and with a bit more going on here than the full strength expression reviewed below, but not as appetizing. 
"
"bruichladdich full strength, 1989 vintage, 13 years old, 57.1 abv %",Single Malt Scotch,84,90,"aged in used bourbon barrels. a fresh, appetizing whisky of brine and white pepper, with an underlying foundation of vanilla, barley, and grassy/hay-like notes. a very subtle teasing of citrus lingers throughout. very clean and straight-forward, with an appetizing finish. a whisky aperitif? 
"
"gordon & macphail single cask #1961 (distilled at bruichladdich) 1989 vintage, 57.9% abv",Single Malt Scotch,84,65,"it is unusual to find a bruichladdich whisky with this much sherry influence-this one is aged in a refill sherry hogshead. i must admit that i generally like a less sherried bruichladdich-it makes it easier to appreciate the distillery's subtle complexities. while there certainly is more than enough sherry to go around in this whisky, the distillery character does manage to fight its way through. this whisky's strong point is that the sherry influence is clean and not insipid like some sherried whiskies. chewy caramel, toffee, and ripe fruit notes are most evident in this whisky, with bruichladdich's signature-an appetizing fresh briny character-emerging midway on the palate through to the finish. if you like bruichladdich and you appreciate a cleanly sherried whisky, then i think you'll enjoy this one."
"bruichladdich 'rocks', 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,50,"fruit is the common thread to this lightly peated whisky; red fruit, that is. red raspberry, red currant, red seedless grape, strawberry, and red apple. a gentle sweetness (creamy vanilla, light molasses) balances all this fruit. not overly contemplative, but delightful. this is definitely  not the same rocks i reviewed two years ago. it is richer, darker in color, and tastes more mature. it's an improved version, and my rating reflects this."
"bruichladdich islay barley 5 year old, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,84,60,"since its reopening eleven years ago this year, bruichladdich has been growing barley on islay—a laudable move. this glimpse into the developing program shows what seems initially to be a delicately fragile dram that soon reveals an intense sweet depth behind the spring flowers. this purity of intent continues on the palate with a thick creaminess that’s typical of the distillery, while a tart finish adds interest. precocious, but already beautifully balanced.£38"
"elements of islay br4 (distilled at bruichladdich), 54.7%",Single Malt Scotch,84,85,"more from bruichladdich. the latest in the elements series is clean in a freshly-showered kind of fashion. the fact that it’s backed up with bran, agave syrup, and pancake batter just helps to emphasize this image of a sunlit breakfast. the palate is sweet, fat, and juicy, typical of how texture is as important as flavor with the laddie. in time there’s some cinnamon with a preserved lemon acidity that enlivens the finish. £55 (500 ml)"
"bunnahabhain amontillado 16 year old, 54%",Single Malt Scotch,84,325,"some single malts just suit specific cask types. such is the case with bunnahabhain and sherry. the spirit has a soft and nutty undertow, plus a gingery note that is given weight and depth by the cask. amontillado, with its nuttier character, is an ideal bridge between the two. this shows surprising maturity with more oxidized and mulch aromas alongside coffee grounds, and a character that’s drifting into meaty. brooding, medium-bodied, slightly dry…but the price? ouch! (fèis ìle 2016, 250 bottles) £250"
"caol ila, 58.4%",Single Malt Scotch,84,153,"without water, this is an aggressive malt, sharp and acerbic. with water, it’s still more in your face than any official bottling. where you tend to associate caol ila with oily, peaty, and maritime characteristics, this is altogether more feisty and ballsier, with a glance to the big three peaty distilleries in the south of islay, and even a nod to its peppery cousin on skye. on the nose there is peat, but it is tempered by dark chocolate; some citrus there, too. the taste is quite sharp, with bitter lemon, licorice, and sooty peat to the fore. certainly an interesting take on this intriguing distillery, and far removed from last year’s relatively gentle 25 year old release, but there are questions over the balance, and whether it’s a better whisky is a moot point. "
"ci6 elements of islay (distilled at caol ila), 61.2%",Single Malt Scotch,84,101,"pale straw. delicate and a little akin to chilled manzanilla sherry: fresh almond, salinity, light yeast. vibrant, with the smoke held in check. the palate is much sweeter, with finally some cask-derived sugars beginning to show. then it rushes to the shoreline and takes a gulp of water, giving an effect like saltwater taffy. it needs water to flesh the palate out. £60/500 ml"
"wemyss malts spiced chocolate cup (distilled at clynelish) 1997, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,108,"this single cask bottling of clynelish from wemyss malts is 16 years old, and just 302 bottles were yielded by the bourbon hogshead in which maturation took place. milk chocolate, orange, and malt on the nose; fragrant, with stem ginger. zesty and notably spicy on the palate, with applesauce, peaches, and digestive biscuits. relatively long in the finish, with oak, allspice, and persistent fruitiness.£67"
"single malts of scotland (distilled at cragganmore), 1985 vintage, 22 year old, 56.7%",Single Malt Scotch,84,100,"if you’re looking for a bold, dry, spicy speysider, this is the one. there’s lots of oak here, with bourbon undertones. a fighting vanilla sweetness manages to keep the whisky from becoming too austere. gritty texture, with cedar wood, clove, spearmint, anise, herbal notes, dried fruit, and dark chocolate. a whisky that awakens the palate. very invigorating. (exclusive to the whisky exchange, london.)  price: approximately $100. 
"
"the dalmore, 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,84,45,"half the whisky was aged in bourbon barrels, the other half in sherry casks. this whisky has always been on my short list as one of the finest, most affordable 12 year old single malts available. while the price may have gone up a bit (i remember when it was $20!), the quality remains the same. it’s fresh and lively. a well-balanced dram, with its tell-tale orange marmalade accompanied by tangerine, pineapple upside-down cake, vanilla-soaked barley, subtle brine, and caramel, all leading to a spicy cinnamon and dried vanilla finish. a nice “every day” dram."
"the dalmore gran reserva, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,84,65,"aged exclusively in first-fill casks (60% of it sherry cask), and its oak intensity shows. sweet, but with a steady dose of dried spice, oak resin, and teasing tobacco to back it up. silky texture and lush, with fallen orchard fruit, tangerine, chocolate-covered orange, and lemon meringue. a firm dried spice finish rounds it all out. sort of like the dalmore 12 year old pumped up on steroids."
"dalwhinnie distillers edition, 1990 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,65,"matured in oloroso casks. the oloroso takes what is typically a pleasingly honeyed, but not particularly complex, malt and adds a layer of fruit to it. crisp, clean notes of lemon, pineapple, and ginger, are softened by honeyed malt, vanilla, and hay. soft, lingering finish. 
"
"dalwhinnie winter’s gold, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,58,"distilled between october and march, matured in american (first-fill and refill) and european oak casks; meant to be served ice-cold. from the freezer, concentrated aromas of pineapple, hints of honey and smoke. at room temperature, less intense fruitiness, more honey, and ginger. a syrupy mouthfeel from the freezer, with soft spices and orchard fruits. the palate is more complex at room temperature, with heathery spice, pepper, apricots, raisins, and milk chocolate. the finish yields cocoa powder and lingering spices. £38"
"edradour 'ballechin (#4),' 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,100,"the fourth release of peated edradour whisky. this time it’s aged in oloroso sherry casks. there’s a lot going on in this whisky. yeah, it’s still a little on the young side, but what it lacks in maturity is compensated by a dynamic youthful complexity. a distinctive whisky, with coal tar, damp kiln smoke, caramelized fruit, smoked almond, walnut, licorice stick, and maple-cured bacon. youthful, sweet, smoky, lingering finish. i’m looking forward to future releases. (6,000 bottles released, but only 900 to the u.s.). 
"
"edradour port cask, 6th release, cask #383, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,90,"the latest in this perthshire distillery’s ongoing port cask series of releases has been wholly matured in a bodega port butt since being distilled in 2003. the nose is fragrant, featuring summer berries and glacé cherries, while the palate suggests canned pineapple with cream, contrasting with red wine notes. the finish is quite lengthy, with raspberries, spicy oak, and a whiff of smoke. "
"edradour ballechin sauternes cask matured, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,135,"the eighth edition of heavily-peated edradour bottled under the ballechin label is part of the distillery’s discovery series and has been aged in sauternes wine casks. the nose yields sweet, fruity smoke, cocoa, and spice. sweet and soft on the palate, with more fruity smoke, notably pineapple-influenced, with a hint of smoked fish. the finish is medium to long, with ashy peat and slightly bitter citrus fruits."
"cask & thistle (distilled at glen grant), 15 year old, 1988 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,50,"a nice example of what port wood finishing should do for a whisky. the port influence (finished one year in a port pipe) has taken what would normally have been a fairly straight-forward whisky when it is young-clean, light, and dry with subtle notes of herbs and spices-and added some extra weight along with balancing sweet toffee and full fruit, without dominating. (bottled exclusively for binny’s beverage depot.) 
"
"scott's selection (distilled at glen grant), 26 year old, 1977 vintage, 53.5%",Single Malt Scotch,84,145,"what is it with all these older, sherried bottles of glen grant from the independent bottlers, anyway? fortunately, this is one of the nicer ones. the balance of sherry and oak is commendable, and the flavor is clean with that glen grant “dried herb” character still evident. sweet fruit notes (berries in honey, peach pits, sultana, ripe grape) along with almonds and tobacco fill out the palate. clean, warming finish. 
"
"single malts of scotland (distilled at glen grant) 1992, 57.8%",Single Malt Scotch,84,127,"the initial nose is soft fruits doused in condensed milk, which contributes to an overall impression of light toffee and, weirdly for this distillery in its contemporary guise, some smoke. the fruits manage to mix the ripe and slightly sour. quite intense; it needs water, which calms proceedings allowing typical glen grant purity to come through. the fruits now have some added weight and, again, that smokiness. intriguing! £75"
"glen grant 12 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,56,"a new addition to the core range, this shows glen grant with a little more weight, but just a little. i’ve never been one for the heavily-sherried versions. here, the distillery’s signature green elements—spring flowers, fresh apple and pear notes are given a little added weight—apple syrup, toffee, and cooked fruits on the palate. if you’d like an alternative to glenlivet or glenfddich 12 then look no further. £43"
"glen ord, milroy’s of soho single cask, 1999, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,74,"a glen ord bottled by the london wine and spirits establishment of milroy’s, and a relatively rare opportunity to sample single malt from this diageo-owned distillery. the nose initially presents lemon zest, then peaches and caramel, with cream soda notes. very fruity and lively in the mouth, with a nutty, malty undercurrent. medium in length; firm, with spicy fruit lasting to the very end, accompanied by a touch of well-mannered fresh oak. £45 currently not available in the u.s."
"glen scotia double cask, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,58,"this relatively youthful whisky was matured in bourbon barrels, before a period in pedro ximénez sherry casks. sweet, red berry notes on the nose, with slightly smoky vanilla and caramel. voluptuous in the mouth, with spicy, rich sherry notes, sultanas, and ginger. spicy sea salt and lingering sherry in the finish. £37"
"gordon & macphail (distilled at glenburgie) 1990 21 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,130,"here’s a rarity. a major player in ballantine’s, this moray coast distillery is rarely seen in single malt guise. very gentle, sweet, and juicy start with licks of cream, a hint of barley, and the gentle grassiness typical of the distillery. in time, light almond and fresh lemon. the palate is lightly sticky — glenburgie for its lightness always shows good succulence — with buttery vanilla, malt, and a touch of toasty oak. gentle, sweet, and refreshing. "
"glendronach, 18 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,136,"there’s plenty going on here, but it’s not as vibrant as the other glendronachs. lots of sherry influence, viscous, and a bit sappy, with curaçao, honey-drenched fruit, raspberry tart, black cherry, and ripe malt leading to a grape stem finish. an enjoyable whisky, but my least favorite of the bunch. "
"glenfarclas family casks 1983 cask #31, 46.1%",Single Malt Scotch,84,724,"in style, this is closest to the 1978 in its levels of sweetness. here, though, there is added key lime pie, juicy white peaches, and whipped cream alongside that deep glenfarclas roasted ‘polished brass’ note. the medium-weight palate is pure and sweet with light orchard fruits. the most freshly acidic of the selection, with a hint of flowers on the very end. £430"
"glenfiddich, age of discovery, 19 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,84,123,"named in honor of the early portuguese explorers, this newest glenfiddich expression has spent a lengthy period of secondary maturation in madeira drums. this has given a rich sweet fruitiness — think blueberry muffins mixed with moss alongside date, fig, and black grape. the palate is sweet and smooth with a pickup of gingery spices toward the finish. well balanced and quite a departure. (travel retail exclusive, not available in the u.s.) £75 "
"glenfiddich ipa experiment, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,70,"one of the duo of releases in glenfiddich’s experimental series, ‘ipa’ was finished for 3 months in casks that previously held the speyside craft brewery’s india pale ale. the nose offers hops and honey, malt, toffee, cooking apples, and lemon. smooth on the palate, with more honey and toffee, soft spices and, ultimately, slightly bitter, hoppy ale notes. the finish is medium in length, with dry spices and plain chocolate."
"exclusive malts 1993 (distilled at glen garioch), 52.4%",Single Malt Scotch,84,140,"this 19 year old example of glen garioch from 1993 offers a nose of orange blossom, sherry, and milk chocolate, becoming sweeter with time. finally, butterscotch mousse. sweet and fruity on the palate, with cherries, icing sugar, and a hint of smoky caramel. medium to long in the finish, with persistent citrus notes, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. (u.s. only)"
"glenglassaugh evolution, 57.2%",Single Malt Scotch,84,78,"following on from revival, glenglassaugh has released 6,000 bottles of evolution, an expression also made after the distillery’s reopening in 2008. it has been matured in first-fill george dickel barrels and bottled at cask strength. peaches and gingerbread on the nose, with brittle toffee, icing sugar, and vanilla. luscious soft fruits dipped in caramel figure on the palate, with coconut and background stem ginger. the finish is medium in length, with spicy toffee.  £50"
"glenglassaugh octaves classic, 44%",Single Malt Scotch,84,72,"glenglassaugh distillery launched both unpeated and peated expressions matured in octave casks, approximately one-eighth the capacity of a butt. they have not been subjected to chill-filtration. the nose of this unpeated classic is sweet, with ripe apples, peaches, toffee, and buttery spice. smooth on the palate, with more peaches and now intense spiciness, followed by vanilla, aniseed, licorice, new oak, and mild cloves in the long, slightly citric finish. £55"
"glengoyne 1996 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,68,"exclusively for the u.s. as an addition between the 10 and the 17 year old. central to its composition is a ‘parcel’ of refill hogsheads, to which a number of european oak butts have been added. initially slightly herbal on the nose, with developing fresh fruits and vanilla. finally, caramel and damp leaves underfoot. full and confident on the palate, with tropical fruits, stem ginger, and hazelnuts. drying in the finish, with spicy, rich oak and creamy allspice. "
"glenkinchie distillers edition, 1991 vintage, 43%, $65",Single Malt Scotch,84,65,"matured in amontillado casks. pleasantly fresh, briny, and yeasty, which works nicely with the atypical toffee and nutty notes. glenkinchie’s dry, grassy character emerges occasionally, as does some delicate background spice and a hint of lime. pretty hefty stuff for lowland malt. 
"
"glenkinchie distillers edition 1996, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,70,"amontillado casks are used here, which add a certain almond-like note to the nose, as well as more obvious oakiness. the effect is a general deepening and lengthening of aroma and flavor. the dry notes have gone, replaced by a sweeter and more generous palette of flavors. the fresh meadow flowers are more like cut flowers in a florist shop, the fruits hint toward peach, and there’s a new citric burst on the finish.  "
"glenmorangie dornoch limited edition, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,92,"this bottling of glenmorangie has been released to raise awareness of marine conservation. a proportion of the whisky has been finished in amontillado sherry butts. the nose offers honey, vanilla, peaches, toffee bonbons, wood lacquer, sherry, and a hint of peat. soft and elegant on the palate, with fruity spice, nutty toffee, more sherry, and sweet smoke. slightly smoky in the finish, with soft oak, citrus fruit, and aniseed. (travel retail only) £60"
"glenmorangie taghta, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,99,"taghta—gaelic for “chosen one”—is the result of glenmorangie’s innovative cask masters program, in which crowd-sourcing strongly influenced the final release. it is non-chill filtered and has been finished in manzanilla sherry casks. fragrant, slightly salty, fruity sherry notes, sweet spices on the nose. new leather and lots of spice on the palate, with olives, rock salt, and a suggestion of red wine. medium in length, drying, with licorice and black pepper. (12,000 bottles) £65"
"glenrothes select reserve, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,84,45,"the first non-vintage glenrothes in recent memory, allowing the distillery more flexibility in cask selection when making a bottling. true to glenrothes, this expression is mouth-coatingly malty, with well-integrated bright fruit notes, creamy vanilla, praline and honey. nutty, delicately spicy finish. 
"
"the glenrothes alba reserve, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,84,60,"matured exclusively in ex-bourbon barrels (american white oak, or quercus alba), and certified kosher. it’s a softer, gentler version of glenrothes. the bourbon oak influence is very evident, showing creamy vanilla and coconut, with additional fruit (orange creamsicle, pineapple, black raspberry, blueberry, and gooseberry). soft, creamy vanilla finish. a pleasant, easy-going, seamless dram—and perhaps the most approachable glenrothes whisky."
"gordon & macphail (distilled at glentauchers), 14 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,65,"fairly straight-forward but pleasing nonetheless. creamy on the nose and palate. nicely malty, too, with interwoven notes of vanilla, caramel custard, and hazelnut, offset nicely by dry oak spices and a hint of peat. a calming whisky best enjoyed after a very stressful day. 
"
"duncan taylor 'rarest of the rare' (distilled at glenury royal), cask #3049, 20 year old, 1984 vintage, 43.5%",Single Malt Scotch,84,180,"thick and very tactile. malty, with good heft. notes of vanilla, honey, biscuit, and caramel custard. a soothing, comforting whisky. on the surface, not very complex, but very satisfying nonetheless. 
"
"highland park, cask #2498, 1986 vintage, 19 year old, 53.8%",Single Malt Scotch,84,120,"amber-gold colored (not as dark as the other beltramo’s offering here), with notes of caramel, honey, heather, and bright fruit, evolving into gentle cinnamon, vanilla, and ginger. soft finish. a highland park for a lazy afternoon. (bottled for beltramo’s fine wines & spirits) 
"
"highland park einar, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,84,68,"einar was joint earl of orkney from 1014, and this bottling moves the warrior series slightly further into familiar highland park territory. some gentle smoke on the nose, with fresh newsprint, ginger, caramel, and a hint of halibut oil. peat smoke, vanilla, and citrus fruit on the palate. a little peat smoke in the medium-length finish. €53/liter"
"douglas laing old particular 1996 (distilled at highland park), 48.4%",Single Malt Scotch,84,151,"this 17 year old single cask (#10042) bottling of highland park was distilled in september 1996 and is presented non-chill filtered and with no added color in douglas laing’s old particular range. baked cereal and peeled apples on the peaty nose, while dark, smoky notes contrast with lighter, fruity flavors on the palate, along with a sprinkling of pepper. the finish dries, with more pepper, bonfire embers, and coffee grounds. £90"
"highland park dark origins, 46.8%",Single Malt Scotch,84,110,"dark origins is a new addition to highland park’s core range, inspired by the distillery’s founder, magnus eunson. the recipe embraces twice as many first-fill sherry casks than that of highland park 12 year old. chocolate malt, caramel, and ripe bananas on the nose, with a whiff of coal dust. silky on the palate, with dry sherry, autumn berries, plus more coal and a spicy, plain chocolate edge. long and dry in the smoky finish, with black pepper."
"lagavulin, 12 year, 57.8%",Single Malt Scotch,84,500,"style: islay single malt scotch color: pale straw aroma: peat smoke-lots of it. damp earth. hint of olives and seaweed. palate: surprisingly gentle in texture and on the light side of medium in body. a malty sweetness balances the dry-ish peat smoke. again the damp earth mid palate. an appetizing saltiness emerges towards the finish, but is fleeting. smoky finish. 
"
"laphroaig cairdeas, 50.5%",Single Malt Scotch,84,60,"distinctively pale in color. (a hint of its age?) this annual limited edition release is finally available in the u.s. youthful, vibrant, and thumping, with the sea flowing through its veins. coal tar, peat smoke, brine, seaweed, bright fruit (pear, tangerine), and soft vanilla all compete for attention. the only thing holding me back from scoring it higher is that it comes across as a bit too youthful."
"laphroaig 15 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,84,80,"brought back as a celebration of the distillery’s 200th anniversary and, in the vein of other 15 year old expressions, is somewhat restrained. rather than big phenols there’s an aroma of lanolin, sautéed scallop, fleshy fruit, and real sweetness. the palate shoes some oozing oils and a whiff of creosote, but this is a tea party rather than a wild ceilidh. maybe bottling at 46% would have given the drive that’s missing."
"gordon & macphail (distilled at ledaig), cask #2, 1994 vintage, 12 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,65,"quite nutty (especially the latter half of the palate), with chewy toffee, vanilla fudge, subtle fruit, and leafy smoke. i like the texture of this whisky. quite satisfying. an improvement over the distillery-bottled 10 year old, which i suggested (vol. 16, no. 2) needed to reach its teens to begin to fully develop. this whisky validates my theory. (bottled for maxwell street trading co.)
"
"douglas laing old & rare (distilled at littlemill) 20 year old, 51.5%",Single Malt Scotch,84,246,"as with rosebank, douglas laing & co. ltd. has made a habit of releasing single malts from the now-demolished distillery of littlemill, which formerly stood not far from auchentoshan. the latest variant was distilled in november 1991 and bottled early in 2012. the nose is fresh and fruity, with vanilla and boiled sweets. sweetly spicy on the straightforward palate, with ginger to the fore. spice continues through the finish, with a hint of cedar. £157"
"cadenhead’s (distilled at littlemill) 36 year old, 40.2%",Single Malt Scotch,84,282,"cadenhead is responsible for this veteran cask strength release distilled in 1977 at the now-demolished distillery of littlemill, located a couple of miles from auchentoshan. the nose is sweet, with icing sugar, vanilla, honey, and peaches. damp grass after a while. initially sweet and full on the palate, slightly resinous, with marzipan and sherbet, then quite bitter oak kicks in. the marzipan and tannins fight it out in the finish. £175"
"gordon & macphail (distilled at longmorn) 30 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,84,140,"amber color. rich, malty aroma with notes of vanilla, honey, oak, and floral undertones. thick, mouth-coating texture. flavors are big and malty, with notes of honey and vanilla up front, then becoming rather dry with oak and subtle citrus. huge, long dry finish. 
"
"adelphi (distilled at longmorn) 1985, 49.2%",Single Malt Scotch,84,320,"plenty of the distillery’s fresh fruits, here with some demerara sugar sprinkled on the top, a little hint of almond, peppermint, candied apple, and hard fruit sweets. the palate continues in the same vein, with some more apple (baked this time) and a chalky texture. water allows it to become more creamy (think orange barley water), while a green fresh note emerges in the background. just slightly bitter behind."
"mackillop's choice (distilled at macallan), 14 year old, 1989 vintage, 58.2%",Single Malt Scotch,84,75,"this expression is atypical for a macallan whisky-the standard macallan line is aged in sherry casks, while this one is aged in a bourbon cask. absent the sherry, this isn’t as sweet or rich. rather, it’s more delicate and gentle. the whisky is very clean and creamy, with lovely floral notes (lavender, heather, rose), intertwined with spices (especially vanilla), and fruit (baked apple, pineapple, coconut). delicate, pleasing finish. one of the better non-sherried whiskies distilled at macallan. (bottled exclusively for the retailer “wine on the 9.”) 
"
"murray mcdavid (distilled at macallan), 1997 vintage, 9 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,70,"an interesting application of macallan, aged originally in a bourbon cask and then in ridge zinfandel barrels. quite sweet and full-flavored, with ripe, jammy fruit, beach plum, subtle (yet deep) toffee, and grape skin, all laced with honey. dynamic, fun, and carefree.
"
"port ellen 32 year old, 52.5%",Single Malt Scotch,84,952,"a mix of two types of cask, both refill. typical port ellen on the nose, very clean, precise, and austere, hiding its sweetness in a new pigskin wallet. though there are hints of apple and almond, it has a chalky edge and surprisingly low levels of smoke. with water there’s squid ink and waxed paper. the palate starts with darjeeling tea and roasted fruits, then heads to the kelp-strewn seashore. as challenging as ever, and actually a bit too dry. £600"
"gordon & macphail (distilled at rosebank) 1989 vintage, 10 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,84,50,"straw gold color. a very aromatic whisky, with dry, delicate herbal, floral notes. light and soft in body. gentle on the palate-delicately sweet and fruity up front, then becoming dry with herbal, spice notes. 
"
"murray mcdavid (distilled at rosebank) 1992, 10 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,150,"pale gold color. aromatic, floral, herbal aromas (a veritable potpourri), with soft background vanilla malt notes and a hint of lemon. light and soft in body. soft, malty vanilla notes on the palate with interwoven notes of herbs, subtle dried fruit, and delicate wood resins. gently dry finish. 
"
"springbank, 10 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,68,"thick barley and viscous, with ever-present brine and berried fruit throughout. underlying notes of waxy fruit (no doubt from some sherry cask aging), clementine, pineapple, and black licorice emerge, followed by the brine kicking in again towards the finish. the most rambunctious of the three. 
"
"hazelburn, 47.4%",Single Malt Scotch,84,95,"springbank’s tasting room bottling of its triple-distilled malt will not disappoint any fan of the official bottling; all its rounded and honeyed characteristics are firmly in evidence here. the nose is soft and sweet, with praline and a touch of condensed sweet malt joining creamed vanilla. without water, the malt is surprisingly robust and prickly. dilute it, though, and it’s a very pleasant drink, with crystallized grapefruit, traces of hickory and menthol, some honey, and sweet candy. later on, spice comes through, and the finish is long, fruity, and spicy. an interesting take, but not a radical departure from the official bottling. "
"murray mcdavid (distilled at strathisla) 1976, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,150,"style: speyside single malt scotch color: golden bronze aroma: syrupy. honey. fruit gum drops. anise. spearmint. palate: thick, viscous, surupy. honey up front, then becoming dry through to the end, with notes of dried fruit, mint, and oak. 
"
"gordon & macphail (distilled at strathisla), cask #8510, 25 year old, 48.7%",Single Malt Scotch,84,185,"very thick in texture and mouthcoating -- almost chewy -- with ripe barley, shortbread cookies, and honey up front. dried vanilla, violet, cinnamon, and bright fruit notes emerge mid-palate. the dried spices and moderate oak tannins linger on the finish, contrasting the whisky’s rich, sweet entry. if this whisky were a road, there would be a lot of hills."
"talisker 175th anniversary bottling, 45.8%",Single Malt Scotch,84,100,"a tamed talisker. the classic talisker personality shows-seaweed, brine, peat smoke, and freshly ground pepper on the finish. there are even other interesting flavors i enjoy, notably vanilla, licorice root, charcoal, and bitter chocolate. but this whisky needs to be a little livelier to be a truly great whisky. while there’s no age statement, there’s older whisky in here for sure, and maybe that’s part of its “reserved” nature. it certainly is a nice whisky, but i would prefer the more vibrant talisker 18 year old -at two-thirds the cost. 
"
"talisker skye, 45.8%",Single Malt Scotch,84,48,"the latest release from talisker is an nas bottling which contains whisky matured in toasted and refill american oak casks. according to the distiller, this is “an easy-drinking talisker…more approachable, but still definitely talisker.” certainly approachable on the nose, with tangerines, honey, and milk chocolate, before ozone and peat smoke develop. ginger and a hint of coal tar. medium-bodied, with citrus fruit and increasingly hot spices, though never overwhelming. spicy peat, white pepper, and aniseed in a nutty finish. £33"
"tobermory 15 year old, 46.3%",Single Malt Scotch,84,110,"aged on the scottish mainland for 14 years and then finished off in sherry casks on the island of mull. a fresh whisky with a hint of brine, along with richer nutty toffee and chocolate fudge, embedded with dried fruit. delicate oak resin peppers the finish, balancing the whisky’s sweetness. one of the best unpeated tobermory whiskies (i.e. non-ledaig) whiskies i’ve tasted. the sherry enhances the whiskey without dominating.
"
"tomintoul 14 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,54,"one of speyside’s youngest distilleries, tomintoul has been a relatively shy performer until recently, when a raft of new releases (some peated) have appeared. this non-chill filtered example is, for me, the best of the bunch. pale in hue, it has a light, clean floral aroma — think daffodils — with plenty of white fruits and very subtle oak. the palate has pear juice, light vanilla, and a long sweet finish. £34 (not available in the u.s.)"
"tomatin 30 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,220,"selected by distillery manager douglas campbell, currently in his 50th year at tomatin. it has been matured in a combination of american and european oak casks, and just 200 cases have been released. citrus fruits on the nose, notably oranges, and apricots, with a hint of damp soil. more fruit on the palate, orange wine gums, ginger, and gentle oak. long and slowly drying in the finish, with encroaching aniseed and tannins. "
"tomatin legacy, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,40,"tomatin legacy has been matured in a combination of bourbon and virgin oak casks, and after an initial release in europe, worldwide availability will follow. honey and malt on the nose, melons; fragrant and mildly herbal. white pepper and ultimately a whiff of treacle. fresh and lively on the sweet, fruity palate, with tinned pineapple, cake mix, and more pepper. quite dry in the medium length finish, with a suggestion of chili. £26"
"cuatro series fino, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,50,"the nose is nutty and earthy, with dry sherry, cooking apples, vanilla, and emerging icing sugar. finally, a hint of sea salt. silky in the mouth, with lively spices, jaffa oranges, muted sherry, and mixed nuts. the finish is medium in length, nutty, with spice and persistent citrus fruit."
"tomatin 12 year old french oak finish, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,40,"exclusive to north america, this bottling was matured in bourbon hogsheads for 9 years, and then finished in french oak casks for a further 3 years. the casks originally contained red wine from the bacalhoa winery. before use by tomatin they underwent a de-char/re-char process. peaches, vanilla, milk chocolate, and ginger on the nutty nose, with new-mown hay. full-bodied, with toffee apples, black pepper, and cloves. lingering warm spices in the finish. (12,000 bottles)"
"tomatin, 57.2%",Single Malt Scotch,84,81,"this nas cask strength expression of tomatin was matured in a mix of bourbon and virgin american oak casks. the nose is sweet and fragrant, with vanilla, cinnamon, and developing coconut ice. silky on the palate initially, softly spiced, with vanilla toffee, pears, and apples; then the spices intensify, introducing a hint of chili. drying in the lengthy, spicy, slightly herbal finish. (282 bottles; exclusive to robertson’s, pitlochry, perthshire) £55"
"tomatin contrasting casks bourbon matured, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,152,"the bourbon cask-matured partner to the sherry matured bottling (see above), this expression similarly comprises a vatting of whisky distilled in 1973, 1977, 1988, 1991, 2002, and 2006. both contrasting casks are offered in non-chill filtered format. apple pie, with buttery caramel, milk chocolate, and coconut on the nose. zesty spices on the early palate, then custard, contrasting lemon, and a note of char. spicy fruits, black pepper, and more char in the finish. £100"
"tomatin cabernet sauvignon 2002, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,87,"initially aged in bourbon barrels, this expression was transferred into cabernet sauvignon wine casks in march 2011 for additional maturation. musty wine notes on the early nose soon become red berries and vanilla. supple on the palate, with big red berry notes, plus honey and ginger. lingering ginger and raspberries in the finish, drying to dark chocolate (2,520 bottles) £70"
"tomatin caribbean rum 2007, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,50,"this 9 year old bottling has been fully matured in caribbean rum barrels. quite delicate on the nose, with wet grass, then emerging coconut and whipped cream. slick on the palate, with an instant tropical fruit hit—ripe banana and pineapple—plus more cream, cinnamon, and hazelnut. spicy and nutty in the finish, with a final tropical fruit tang (6,600 bottles) £40"
"single malts of scotland (distilled at tormore) 1988, 64.2%",Single Malt Scotch,84,150,"there’s something rather round peg in a square hole about tormore, that grand urban palace of a distillery in wildest speyside. the whisky, sadly, is often the same. here, though, things look promising to start with: rice crackers, and a spicy, rye-like hardness on top of a vanilla-accented, sweet trail mix of a nose with some earthiness behind. the palate, for me, is still too rigid. for all its efforts to relax, this tormore remains tense. £90"
"tullibardine 1988, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,75,"tullibardine has been offering a 1988 vintage edition for several years, but in 2011 it bottled a new variant at 23 years of age, matured in a mixture of first-fill bourbon barrels and ex-sherry hogsheads. malt, vanilla, carnations, and peaches on the full nose. the palate is initially sweet and fruity, with toffee, lively spices, and more herbal notes duly appearing. the finish features cereal, spice, and white chocolate. £47"
"tullibardine 500 sherry, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,70,"finished principally in pedro ximenez spanish sherry casks, tullibardine 500 sherry has a fragrant nose, with new leather, beeswax, apple, and vanilla. the palate is smooth and sherried, with more leather, brittle toffee, orange peel, honey, and nutmeg. the fruity finish is notably spicy, with lingering wood polish notes. "
"tullibardine custodians’ release 1970, 40.5%",Single Malt Scotch,84,1900,"the second release in the custodians’ series was matured in two sherry hogsheads—one first-fill and the other second-fill. this 46 year old is presented at cask strength. the early nose offers herbal and menthol notes, old resin, citrus fruits, then milk chocolate-coated peppermint creams… idiosyncratic. the palate is quite thin, with more citrus fruits, almonds, and developing wood notes. the finish is lightly oaky and mouth-drying, with a touch of black pepper."
"oban distillers edition 1996, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,77,"this is clearly oban. time in montilla fino casks hasn’t diminished the fresh fruitiness. the orange zestiness has also been retained. like the ‘kinchie, what the finish has done is allow the palate to thicken out and show what seems like a more mature personality. a new heavy floral note emerges. all in all, there is greater concentration and ripeness with an added ginger note. another edition that improves on the original."
"the antiquary 12 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,27,"thick, viscous golden syrup, digestive biscuits, and almond joy bars underpin some soft, peaty aromas. it’s rather an appealing combination. satin smooth on the tongue, with lemon, lime, orange, and dried pineapple, but enough malt to keep things interesting. the finish riffs on a ripe lemon theme accompanied by spicy stardust. for the few extra bucks, the more mature component whiskies make for a richer, fuller, and more satisfying experience than the antiquary’s red-labeled bottle."
"wemyss malts ‘caribbean fruits,’ 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,127,"wemyss malts names the sources of these single cask bottlings for the first time in the series. ‘caribbean fruits’ is a 1990 glencadam. the hogshead in which it was matured has yielded just 320 bottles. sweet on the nose, with apricots, fudge, creamy vanilla, and drinking chocolate. tropical fruits on the palate, with malt, hazelnuts, and spicy oak. tannins and cocoa powder in the finish. £80"
"wemyss malts cayenne cocoa bean 1997 (distilled at clynelish), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,104,"one of two single cask bottlings of 17 year old clynelish released by wemyss malts in the fall of 2014. the hogshead provided 373 bottles. pineapple and nectarines on the nose, with salted caramel. mildly herbal. the palate is rich and viscous, with a sprinkling of pepper over sliced red apples, sweet spices, vanilla, and hazelnuts. lingering in the finish, with lemon; nutty and lightly oaked. £68"
"wemyss malts banquet of fruits 1994 (distilled at aberfeldy), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,131,"distilled in 1994 and matured in a single hogshead, this 21 year old expression is part of wemyss malts’ 2016 midsummer single cask release. rich, stewed fruits, honey, and allspice on the pleasing nose. voluptuous on the palate with spicy apple and cranberry. the finish dries quite rapidly to aniseed and spicy oak. (220 bottles) £100"
"wemyss malts velvet fig, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,84,61,"who could refuse a blend of single malts wholly matured in oloroso sherry casks? they’ve perfectly bottled the aroma of molten tiffin: the chocolate, cocoa, biscuit, raisin, dried dates, and walnut are all here. sipping brings on chocolate, coffee, malt, ginger, nutmeg, and dried fig. there’s no slow reveal, it pretty much lays its cards on the table immediately; rather than developing flavors, they extinguish one, by one leaving a finish of cocoa and maltiness. (6,000 bottles) £40"
"wemyss malts rosy apple brûlée  (distilled at invergordon) 1988,  46%",Single Grain Whisky,84,115,"perfect for fall; like strolling through an orchard polishing a windfall apple before crunching into its juicy fruit. nose of caramel, dry worked wood, banana chips, cinnamon, and indian spices. the palate is warming, with apple juice backed by a slowly growing spice note, later caramels, and a slight oxidized apple and brown peel note to end. the finish has a mildly bitter apple tinge and buzzing spices. the apple sings out with a dash of water. (494 bottles) £89"
"black bull 12 year old, 50%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,55,"a solid presence in the range, the strength and malt content continue to mark these out over their contemporaries. grapefruit peels, sliced juicy orange, and lemon butter icing on the nose. the palate is thinner than others in the range, with crystallized orange, fudge, plus cardamom and mild pepper. the finish of sugared satsumas is boosted by a long lasting trail of spices."
"isle of skye, 8 year old, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,29,"what a surprise! really thick and malty for a blend (there’s a high malt content here for sure), and also nicely mature for 8 years old. great balance too, with the island aggressiveness tamed by a rich, malty elegance. delicious honey, toasted oak, firm peat, dark chocolate, and glazed citrus meld nicely with the malt, leading to a honeyed, lightly-peppered finish. very enjoyable."
"lombard gold label, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,17,"good weight to this blend. creamy and mouth-coating on the palate, with a nice malty, honey-tinged backbone. bright fruitabounds, with golden raisin, lemon meringue, peach, and a hint of pineapple. notes of creamy vanilla and gently nutty, through to its soft finish. 
"
"islay mist, 17 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,80,"deeper and darker when compared to its younger siblings, but with the same personality. drier, especially on the finish, with added oak resin, espresso, leather, and tobacco. bonus points for character.
"
"kilchoman single cask release cask #370 (distilled 2008, bottled 2014), 59.8%",Single Malt Scotch,84,95,"an uncommon exclusive bottling of a 6 year old cask strength malt. light gold in color, the nose is vegetal, more peat bog than peat smoke, with an undercurrent of pastry cream and rose. it’s an odd combination of aromas. the entry is flavorful and inviting with smoked pineapple, clove, and rose. peak smoke arrives in full force in the mid-palate, which drops the sweet and becomes spicy. the finish is mostly smoke, but with a pleasant minty coolness.  (wyoming only)"
"kilchoman sanaig, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,75,"a new, and welcome, permanent member of the core kilchoman range, this comes from a mix of sherry finished and sherry matured whisky. the nose kicks off with a lovely cigar ash note—a cigar club toward the end of the evening—and while there are some dried fruits from the sherry, kilchoman’s gentle, light character gives energy and lemony lift—shellfish, grass, and herbs. lovely balance. rounded, softly fruity, and highly approachable."
"stronachie, 12 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,50,"a “branded” malt, meaning we don’t know which distillery this whisky came from. fresh and quite fruity (peach, nectarine, golden raisin, orange, pineapple) with a nice underlying honey, vanilla, and caramel sweetness. soft, gentle, malty finish. it’s clean, nicely balanced, and pleasant."
"hazelburn 8 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,70,"hazelburn was first produced at springbank during 1997. it varies stylistically from ‘traditional’ springbank, as it is triple distilled using unpeated malt. the 8 year old expression has been matured in 60 percent ex-bourbon and 40 percent sherry wood. the nose is fresh, light, fruity, and faintly resinous, with gentle spice. sherbet, malt, and vanilla on the attractive and lively palate, with developing spicy oak and a hint of pepper in the finish. "
"master of malt boxes blend, 40.9%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,90,"master of malt is an online whisky company that seems to try its hand at most things and is bringing a fresh irreverence to the world of whisky. this was created in partnership with the bass guitarist of british rock band athlete, and it's rather good. sweet and rich with toffee, orange chocolate, and honey, it's another blend with a lot to say for itself.  £55"
"master of malt secret bottlings series 8 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,35,"master of malt has accumulated quite a trophy cabinet for their work on blends. the nose is inviting, with butter toffee, bramley apples, fennel seeds, cut lawns, and chocolate-covered oat biscuits. it’s a pretty smooth proposition, serving up caramel maltiness, stewed apple, and orange and grapefruit pith, with just a hint of sharp lemon freshness to open up with. the ginger finish is zappy but short. a solid, everyday blend."
"double barrel talisker/craigellachie, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,84,49,"we don't see very much craigellachie as a single malt because most of it goes into blending, and from that we might draw the conclusion that it's not particularly distinctive in its own right. if it plays a role in this mix it's a submissive one then, because after a not altogether enticing nose that has gooseberry, green salad, and some prickly chili pepper, the palate is all about a mouth-coating big pepper hit that stays long into the finish. €40"
"auld reekie, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,84,60,"the old name for edinburgh has been hijacked for use on this mix of islay malts, and appropriate it is. the creosote, damp outbuilding, and oily rope nose is distinctive and strong, the peat pronounced in the taste, though gooseberry, green melon, and a trace of kumquat are also in the mix, and there's pepper in there too. but ultimately the peat holds out and brings up the finish. "
"grant’s signature, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,29,"brian kinsman’s new creation was inspired by their founder william grant, with a remit to create a malty blend of character. digestive biscuits, malt, honeycomb, and confectioner’s chocolate melted over a bain-marie. it’s a satisfyingly rich dram, well-structured with a great mouthfeel that wanes with natural dilution. banoffee pie, caramel biscuits, and maltiness deepen to flavors of coffee bean and molasses, leaving a teeth-coating finish of black coffee. (uk and france only) £18"
"that boutique-y whisky company (distilled at glentauchers) 17 year old, 48.8%",Single Malt Scotch,84,76,"it will soon be 120 years since this workhorse of a distillery came into being. golden grahams, sanded oak, whole lemon, floral blooms, and cumin seeds on the nose, but the whole confection is rather restrained. the palate is sweet, but could be too sweet for some; scottish tablet, caramel, ripe banana, granulated sugar, and ginger loaf. some late heat accompanies the sugary finish. remember to brush your teeth before bed."
"that boutique-y whisky company (distilled at north british) batch 1, 51.1%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,84,76,"custard creams, lemon peel, and clotted cream create easygoing aromas on this drop from the mighty edinburgh grain distillery. the palate moves rapidly through flavors of lemon cake and lime zest, to grapefruit sharpness and fresh pineapple, reaching a plateau of sherbet and tangerine. like a bulldog chewing a wasp, there’s lip-puckering sharpness throughout, though it’s judiciously dosed with sufficient sweetness to counterbalance it. a great introduction to the delights of the single grain category. (117 bottles) £48"
"that boutique-y whisky company (distilled at caledonian) 29 year old, 47.7%",Grain Scotch Whisky,84,74,"as young a caledonian as you’ll find; i found the nose rather underdeveloped. crystallized lemon slices, green banana, solvents, dry grasses, and a sniff of nail polish remover. in the mouth, lemon flavors, saccharine sweet honey, and banana dipped in melted chocolate, while the alcohol nips at the tongue. a good trajectory redeems its character, leaving deep throbbing spice notes in the finish, with bitter citrus at the fringes."
"that boutique-y whisky company (distilled at invergordon) 25 year old, 49.8%",Grain Scotch Whisky,84,49,"more typical grain whisky territory here, with a nose of cornflakes, fresh cream, cut grass, filaments of orange peel, and a curiously dull pepper note. spice, sweetness, and citrus fight for dominance. spice wins with a k.o. on sweetness and lays the citrus out cold on the canvas. creamy chocolate notes tarnished with hot pepper on the finish, though coffee-pot flavors emerge with a dash of water."
"sir edward’s 12 year old blended whisky, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,22,"a very different whisky to its unaged namesake, and most unlike any of the other blends tasted for this issue. that’s no bad thing.
this is less sweet than most blends, with tobacco leaf and ashtray to the fore, and a dusty, grainy note with a touch of oak, grape skin, and sweet heather. that said, not a lot of evidence of the 12 years in cask."
"cadenhead’s (distilled at braes of glenlivet) 16 year old, 56.9%",Single Malt Scotch,84,100,"i have a soft spot for the braes: not only a forgotten part of speyside, but the only distillery whose roof i’ve stood on. anyway, here you have yeastiness and a smell like just-baked, sugar-topped apple pie, the fruit cracking through warm pastry. sweet, direct, and slightly nervy, braes is never going to be a heavy hitter, but this is the ideal dram to conjure up fading memories of summer."
"royal salute the diamond tribute, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,270,"how can you really compare this to a quality blend priced under $50? it's hard not to view this as a victory of style over substance, and i object to premium whiskies being just 40% abv, but nevertheless this is excellently made and the blending of whiskies over 21 years is exemplary. it's rich and viscous with light peach and plum notes and a pleasant earthy base."
"douglas laing old particular (distilled at craigellachie) 18 year old, 48.4%",Single Malt Scotch,84,123,"amber. a thick nose with touches of fresh varnish and a little oiliness. has some substance and weight and the heavy florals (lily, jasmine) typical of mature craig, alongside toffee. the palate is ripe, juicy, and full, the cask adding a slight resinous edge. appears slightly smoky. becomes fleshy, even waxy, with water, and decidedly more elegant. the tannins are supple and some herbal notes emerge. it is at its best neat, or with water on the side. £80"
"douglas laing old particular (distilled at deanston, cask 10,426) 1994, 51.7%",Single Malt Scotch,84,133,"distilled in june 1994, this example of deanston was aged for 20 years in a refill butt, which ultimately yielded 188 bottles. quite shy on the nose, a hint of starch, gentle malt, and ginger. shows its true colors on the palate: relatively full-bodied and sweet, with peaches and over-ripe apricots. softly spiced. the finish is lengthy and sweet, with cocoa powder and sprightly oak. £87"
"douglas laing provenance (distilled at caol ila) 6 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,73,"pale straw. this is a classic young caol ila, all elbows and knees. there is sweetness, but it’s counteracted by this briny edge and an aroma like firelighters in among smoldering peat. shut your eyes and it could be mezcal. the smoke envelops the palate while you pick out edible seaweed and smoked oyster on the tongue. very bright and would make a good aperitif/highball. £50"
"douglas laing single minded speyside 24 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,125,"huge marzipan/almond notes greet you on the first sniff. this then moves into an aroma like crepe bandage and even a hint of ointment, then lychee and some maltiness. the palate is surprisingly feisty, with a little orange. water brings out mash tun aromas and a pleasing whiff of sheep pens. when diluted, the palate is very pretty, with the almond returning. easy drinking. £80"
"douglas laing xtra old particular (distilled at carsebridge) 50 year old 1965, 40.1%",Single Grain Whisky,84,345,"this was distilled the year before carsebridge joined scottish grain distillers under distillers company limited (dcl). it brings a nose of toasted muffins, whole lemon, light honey, vanilla, pencil shavings, and a slight herbal hit. smooth, thick, and viscous, with light lemon, honey, gentle spices, peach melba, and toffee. the finish is silky and mouth-coating; rich and luxuriant. a venerable, pleasant old grain, but it lacks the zing to become truly exceptional and distinctive. (101 bottles) £267"
"the exclusive malts (distilled at strathclyde) 26 year old 1988 (cask #62016), 55.1%",Single Grain Whisky,84,180,"an uncommon 26 year lowland single grain whisky made from wheat and aged in refill bourbon casks. oak is quite present on the nose, but it's not alone: there's also bright citrus, pine, and white cake. the opening is softer with vanilla and apricot, but it's only a brief respite before a very spicy mid-palate focused around oak and white pepper. there is a fair amount of fire from the alcohol, which drives a very spicy and dry finish. (u.s. only)"
"duncan taylor (distilled at glenallachie) 6 year old, 52.8%",Single Malt Scotch,84,84,"another blast of new oak. fat and creamy, with distinct charred elements along with stewing pineapple, banana fritters, white chocolate, suntan oil, and a melting bar of nut-filled milk chocolate. an instructive dram showing how maturity is very different from age. with water, some of the distillery finally pokes through. to be honest, it’s slightly too much for me; like overdosing on cotton candy or sugar-topped donuts. £54"
"macphail’s collection (distilled at glenturret) 2000, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,84,60,"this 2000 vintage expression from glenturret was matured in refill sherry hogsheads before bottling in 2015 as part of gordon & macphail’s “macphail’s collection” range. the nose is earthy, with vanilla, treacle, and dark berries, plus fruit spices. full-bodied in the mouth, with spicy, zesty plums, raisins, cocktail cherries, and nutmeg. the finish is lengthy, with black treacle, cocoa powder, and an edge of slightly bitter oak."
"gordon & macphail connoisseurs choice 1999 (ledaig, distilled at tobermory), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,78,"this peated expression from tobermory distillery has been aged in refill, remade hogsheads. the nose offers earthy peat, citrus fruit, vanilla, and smoked haddock in butter. big, sweet peat notes on the peppery palate, with marshmallows and lively spices. the spices linger to the close, with peat embers and a hint of brine on the lips. £60"
"wemyss malts lead on macduff! 2002 (distilled at macduff), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,96,"while most wemyss malts’ releases are named after flavor descriptors, this one adopts a well-known shakespearean reference. a sherry butt filled in 2002 gave an out-turn of 854 bottles. the nose offers toffee bonbons, coffee with condensed milk, and finally farmyard aromas. the palate is relatively sweet, with spicy sherry notes and contrasting mildly citric fruit, plus a slight earthiness. the finish is medium to long, with lingering spice and a carry-over of coffee from the nose. £57"
"port dundas 18 year old, 43%",Single Grain Whisky,84,100,"this is a little darker in color than its younger counterpart (see below), although it is achieved without the complex recipe of different cask maturation that characterized the 2011 special releases bottling. weetabix, hazelnut shells, and the aroma of warm pretzels from a street vendor waft out of the glass. it’s a soft, silky, wheat-flavored whisky that reaches into dark toffee and nutty territory. imagine a molten toffee crisp, if you like. a nougat and walnut-whip finish. distinctively different."
"strathmill 25 year old (diageo special release 2014), 52.4%",Single Malt Scotch,84,475,"light gold. fresh and lightly nutty/biscuity combined with a gently swelling aroma of fruit syrups, green grape, lime (or green) jelly babies, and quetsch, with that nut flour underneath. the palate is similarly smooth, creamy, and upfront, with a decidedly acidic zing to the finish before the wood finally shows its presence. a soft, delicious whisky that ticks all the right boxes but doesn’t really set the world alight. (2,700 bottles)"
"highland queen 12 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,76,"at this age, there are more linear displays of fruit and sweetness than the 8 year old. behind the tarte tatin, butterscotch, light pepper, and wood spice is a green, verdant nose of wet foliage and public lawns in the morning mist. it has a light to medium-weight texture of sugary butterscotch, strawberry, and raspberry developing around an oak and malt core. when the fruit flavor withers, there is a drop off in flavor, leaving a malty melee. £48"
"syndicate 58/6 premium, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,160,"an odd non-age stated blend that uses a solera system to get a drop of the original 1958 blend into the mix. the blend is then finished for four years in oloroso casks. it's a bit of blending gymnastics. very sherry influenced, with marionberry jam, malt, salt, and oak. the integration and flavors are nice, but it all feels a bit muted. a medium length and dry finish shows off some of the younger spirit in the mix. (u.s. only)"
"label 5 gold heritage, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,45,"master blender graham coull hand-selected a variety of aged stock and cask types for this new global addition to the label 5 range. vanilla, dark fruit, and gentle spices on the nose, but the appeal lies in the beautiful, clingy mouthfeel. warm marmalade, nuts, and oak flavors with whispers of cinnamon and clove combine to produce a creamy, smooth dram. it builds and builds but never feels like it fully arrives. the finish is drying with dampened-down spices. €40"
"mackillop’s choice (distilled at tormore) 1988, 55.6%",Single Malt Scotch,84,183,"full gold. good cask interaction here, allowing a light tropical fruit element to emerge alongside peach and apricot. juicy and sweet, in other words, with none of the usual tormore rigidity. the palate is equally concentrated, showing some heat, with a decent degree of fleshy elegance. water brings out more dry elements: brown bracken, hayloft. it begins to firm up, but it is good enough to change folks’ minds about this distillery. £125"
"glen turner heritage double wood, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,20,"it’s double wood, jim, but not as we know it. here, the blend has been given a madeira finish, presenting an appealing nose of spun sugar, golden raisins, cinnamon, nutmeg, and hazelnut. the blend has a creamy texture, with good weight to carry the flavors of orange peel, mango, and dried pineapple, leading to a zesty spark on swallowing. wood spices, nuttiness, and lingering toffee make for a satisfying finish. the extra madeira maturation is understated and perfectly judged."
"the lost distillery company classic selection benachie, 43%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,84,43,"benachie, formerly known as jericho, was an aberdeenshire distillery built southeast of huntly that existed from 1822–1913. a dark amber dram with a nose of marmalade, ground almond, cherry lips, and vanilla essence. attractive, but not overly aromatic. cooked plums after a peppery rush begin an attenuated flavor journey, exiting with a spicy finale."
"cadenhead authentic collection 28 year old (distilled at highland park), 48.3%",Single Malt Scotch,84,191,"distilled in 1985, this expression of highland park was matured in a single bourbon cask that yielded 252 bottles. green apples, tinned mandarin oranges, linseed, and a hint of smoky chocolate on the nose. sweet spices, coconut, and mild peat smoke on the light palate. lingering peat smoke, root ginger, and a touch of vanilla in the medium-length finish. £120"
"cadenhead’s (distilled at caol ila) 1984, 50.7%",Single Malt Scotch,84,400,"surprisingly punchy for its age, there’s very little cask activity here, so what you get is a reduction of caol ila into oils (lanolin) and whiffs of the harbor (drying fishing nets) rather than overt smokiness. the palate is gentle and shy, with an unctuous feel that drifts into poached pear and light cream. delicate, but also oozing with character. best neat."
"cadenhead’s (distilled at glentauchers) 1989, 55.2%",Single Malt Scotch,84,275,"this example of the little-seen glentauchers immediately shows classic distillery character, which is in the green grassy camp. this verdant aspect continues into fresh fruit salad, with enough ripeness to indicate the time spent in cask. this mix of freshness and weight extends onto the tongue, although the impact fades soon after a light spicy tingle on the back palate. i’d happily have a couple."
"hepburn’s choice (distilled at blair athol) 12 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,56,"this single cask bottling from langside distillers was aged in a sherry butt and bottled in 2015. candied orange peel on the early nose, soft sweet sherry, and glacé cherries. fragrant, with milk chocolate-coated turkish delight. sweet, spicy sherry, plus pepper and cinnamon on the uncomplicated palate. fruity spices in the medium-length finish. (222 bottles, robertsons of pitlochry exclusive) £45"
"douglas laing old particular (distilled at girvan) 25 year old 1989, 51.5%",Single Grain Whisky,84,117,"from the most westerly grain distillery in scotland comes this wee charmer, offering coconut fondant, galia melon, fresh cream, and a pleasing, fragrant foliage note (walking through dense reed beds in early summer). a big, juicy dram with citrus, tropical fruits, and dabs of white pepper heat. the creaminess builds as dilution occurs, then it reaches a natural plateau and hits cruise. an intensely tangy and long finish of dried fruits. (232 bottles) £81"
"douglas laing old particular (distilled at north british) 27 year old 1988, 50.2%",Single Grain Whisky,84,122,"drawn from a single refill barrel, the nose is like a day in the life of a honeybee: streams of pollen, rich nectar, heady scents of flying over bright summer flowers and summer picnics of white peaches and lemonade before returning to the hive to the sweet, sticky honey. it’s quite a buzz! there’s an acidic palate of lemon juice, lime, honey, and lemon pith bordering on bitterness. the finish is incredibly dry, like someone just invented lemon-scented sandpaper. (168 bottles) £85"
"douglas laing old particular (distilled at strathclyde) 27 year old 1987, 51.5%",Single Grain Whisky,84,124,"creamy vanilla, fresh-cut grass, gentle herbal notes, murray mints, and the warm newsprint wrappers of fish and chips on the coast (in a lovely, comforting way). the cereals provide a sweet biscuit note, butterscotch candy, gingersnaps, and a nip of aniseed. the outturn of cask #10804, its taste develops with dried orange peel, cookie dough, and vanilla. quite scrumptious! fading slowly, it leaves behind gentle spices and syrup-drizzled popcorn. (198 bottles) £86"
"port charlotte 2007 cc:01, 57.8%",Single Malt Scotch,84,98,"an immediate and perhaps surprising smokiness which brings to mind cask-aged mezcal (tepeztate to be precise), and it is this green, celery-accented element playing off some oily, nutty, and farmyard notes that gives balance and intrigue. water reveals its youth, but there’s enough cask action to add some weight to the palate, where the natural sweet spirit shows itself. keenly priced. worth a look next time you are flying. (travel retail exclusive) £68"
"wolfburn the kylver series, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,84,81,"matured in bourbon casks, this is the second release from the fledgling caithness distillery. clearly youthful on the nose, but not raw, with ginger, melon, and background resin. ultimately, mildly floral. chili notes on the relatively dry palate, with nutmeg and spicy oak. the finish is on the short side of medium in length, peppery, and slightly bitter. once decanted, this dram improves significantly and is rated on that basis. (1,200 bottles)£65"
"bruichladdich octomore 6.1 5 year old, 57%",Single Malt Scotch,84,161,"smoke comes at you immediately, the morning-after smoke of a spent fire, mixing with reeds and rushes, a touch of coconut, and light oak. water is needed to bring out sweetness alongside the band-aid note typical of many young peaty whiskies. the palate is a lot sweeter than the nose suggests, bold and quite thick; honey adding a sticky quality that then moves into creosote and antiseptic cream. it needs hefty degrees of dilution. a work in progress. £100"
"exclusive regions single grain (distilled at north british) 10 year old, 50%",Single Grain Whisky,84,55,"the nose has a conspicuous grain quality to it, like a bouquet of flowers in a nail salon. in addition to acetone, there is orange fondant and the smell of new legos. soft marshmallow and orange cream dilute to strawberry candy, soft peaches, and pineapple, but it’s all swept aside by a tabasco jackhammer that ricochets between the tongue and palate. finish of gatorade fruit punch and ginger root. (246 bottles)"
"jamie stewart, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,16,"with whiskies aged for 5 years in bourbon barrels, this has a pleasant nose of dark toffee, vanilla, toasted whole grain bread, and light spices. the mouthfeel is a bit flabby; chocolate and toasted spices, especially cinnamon and pepper, are quelled by malty caramel, baked orange, and touches of old leather. the finish is dry, malty, and slightly nutty, with a hollow core of spices. a bit dour overall."
"john barr reserve, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,84,25,"this blend has been a whyte and mackay whisky for 25 years. the nose has spice, toffee, wheat biscuits, and smoke, but the combination feels a little benign. the palate is jammy, lightweight, and middle-of-the-road. with a backbone of grain, there are flavors of graham cracker, chocolate ganache, well-baked fruitcake, banoffee pie, smoke, and dried peels, with a burst of spices on the finish."
"cardhu, 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,83,43,"this soft, bright, easy-going whisky is back in the u.s. after being absent for several years. very fragrant, with vibrant fruit (nectarine, plum, guava, pineapple, clementine), honeyed vanilla, and subtle macadamia. fairly light (a pre-dinner or leisurely afternoon malt, perhaps?), but evenly balanced. a gentle introduction to single malts for the blended scotch drinker. "
"compass box oak cross, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,83,40,"a blend of three different single malts. its name derives from the fact that the whisky is aged in american oak bodies with french oak heads (a cross of both oaks). there’s no age statement, but the whiskies are all older than ten years. this is a gentle, subtly complex, somewhat lithe, easy drinking whisky (and with less oak spice than its predecessor, the spice tree). people think whisky is an after-dinner drink, but i think this would make a great aperitif because of its delicate dry spice notes and light body. i’m picking up evenly-proportioned notes of vanilla and coconut, with more subtle notes of clove, anise, and delicate fruit, all wrapped up in a gentle, malty body. a very versatile whisky. 
"
"the famous jubilee, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,83,39,"a tribute this time from edrington group in the form of this one-off blend of the famous grouse. the sherried element seems to have been upped as it shows lavish amounts of dark chocolate, black cherry, and a little treacle, with some orange peel and, with water, raspberry and heather.  the palate shows a hint of smoke and builds through rich flavors to a toffee-accented finish. subtle and long. £25"
"johnnie walker explorers’ club collection the gold route, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,83,95,"described as “an exotic mix of bananas, mango, pitaya, pineapples, guava, passion fruit, and raisins, all balanced perfectly by deep charred peaty notes.” it sort of is, but this isn't a soft, silky smooth dessert whisky; it's rod stewart singing air supply's “all out of love.” it's soft and gentle, but the gravel may put off the softies, and it's far too bland to appeal to fans of maggie may. between a rock and a hard place."
"wild scotsman, 15 year old, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,83,85,"pleasingly aromatic and floral, with lively fruit, fresh cereal grain, honey and vanilla cream. subtle grassy, hay notes add complexity. a very friendly whisky, conjuring up images of a sunny afternoon in spring. 
"
"black bottle, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,83,25,"in terms of bang for your buck this has always been one of the very best blends, punching well above its weight. whether you feel the same about this revamped version depends on how much you want a peat punch. previously rough and gutsy, this is softer, with more licorice and treacle but also more younger sappiness. smoke has the last say but it's like an aging sportsman, replacing energy and attitude with guile and subtlety."
"ardmore, 25 year old, 51.4%",Single Malt Scotch,83,195,"ardmore is a rising star in the world of single malt. until four years ago it was little known in its own right, its main purpose being as a key malt in teacher’s. then ardmore traditional was released, and it’s been winning over drinkers ever since. that malt is a delicatessen whisky: smoky, oily, and savory, a unique highland malt with much to recommend it. this is a different proposition altogether. it’s clean and sweet, with pineapple candy, dusty and almost incense-like spices, and a liberal dose of sweet peat. some citrus notes, too. the peat holds out until the end with impressive effect. there’s talk of this becoming a permanent part of the ardmore portfolio. let’s hope so: it’s further proof that ardmore is a very interesting distillery indeed. (travel retail and selected specialist whisky shops.) "
"the arran malt, st. emilion wine cask finish (limited edition), 50%",Single Malt Scotch,83,80,"rich, good body, blueberry muffin, black cherry, a lot of tannic grip (perhaps a little too much for balance). not as polished as the pomerol or madeira."
"arran machrie moor 5th edition, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,62,"arran distillery has been making peated batches of spirit since 2004, and this nas bottling is the fifth release of that spirit, peated to 20 ppm. the outturn is 12,000 bottles. nutty peat, spicy malt, toffee, and lemon on the mildly savory nose. vibrant on the palate, with lots of citrus fruit. a bonfire smokiness develops steadily, with spice, nuts, and plain chocolate through to the relatively long finish, which features a persistent citric note."
"auchentoshan, 16 year old, 53.7%",Single Malt Scotch,83,120,"a very textural whisky. incredibly creamy, with mouth-coating vanilla, honeyed barley, hay, linseed oil, clementine, and subtle peach. the whisky continues to cling to the palate long after the finish. it’s what you would expect auchentoshan to taste like, but bolder. a nice whisky, but lacking the polish of the standard 21 year old expression. 
"
"auchentoshan american oak, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,83,40,"american oak is new to the auchentoshan core range in 2014 and is the first release from this lowland distillery to be matured solely in first-fill bourbon casks. an initial note of rosewater, then madeira, vanilla, developing musky peaches, and icing sugar. spicy fresh fruit on the palate, chili notes, and more madeira and vanilla. the finish is medium in length, and spicy to the end."
"balblair 2004 bourbon matured, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,74,"the bourbon matured variant of balblair’s two travel retail expressions of its 2004 vintage is available on a worldwide basis. light and delicate on the initial nose, with ripe pear, melon, lemon, watery toffee, and hints of honey and ginger. sweet orchard fruits on the palate, with developing cinnamon, coconut, and crème brûlée. tingling spices in the finish, with slightly drying oak."
"the balvenie new wood, 17 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,83,90,"the tell-tale rich honeyed balvenie personality is spiced up by finishing it off in new charred oak casks, making a normally masculine whisky even bigger. the honeyed malt impacts the palate first, with intermediate notes of citrus fruit, followed by dried spices (cinnamon, vanilla, ginger, and cocoa). the new oak impact is most evident on the whisky’s long, dry, spicy finish. a nice whisky, but perhaps a tad too much new oak for greatness? 
"
"the balvenie signature, batch #1, 12 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,83,55,"good, straightforward, moderately sherried balvenie. classic honeyed notes combine with vanilla, ripe barley, glazed citrus, apricot marmalade, cinnamon, and nutmeg. a nice entry level balvenie, a solid effort. 
"
"duncan taylor 'rarest of the rare' (distilled at banff), cask #3421, 30 year old, 1975 vintage, 43.5%",Single Malt Scotch,83,225,"very fruity and spicy. high, bright fruit notes of lemon, mandarin, and mango, with a sprinkling of ginger and powdered vanilla. oak kicks in on the end, leading to a fairly dry finish, which is not surprising for a 30 year old whisky. 
"
"the benriach arumaticus, 12 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,85,"finished in a dark rum cask. notes of peat, smoked mackerel, and suggestions of charcoal married with molasses, vanilla wafer, golden raisin, cantaloupe, and a dollop of honey. it’s missing the more defined fruit notes that the other two have. i’d like to see this at 15 years to give it more depth. 
"
"the benriach 16 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,90,"in the same genre as benriach 12 year old reviewed below, but more concentrated, with additional notes of resinous oak, light toffee, and soft caramelized pear. 
"
"benriach, sauternes wood finish, 16 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,113,"lovely golden honey color. lush and sweet (the sauternes impact is obvious), with honey-drenched apricot, sultana, and lemon gum drops. vanilla, candied nuts, and subtle botanicals round out the palate. decent oak grip on the finish keeps the whisky from being too cloying.
"
"benriach 35 year old, 42.5%",Single Malt Scotch,83,690,"a venerable bottling from its proprietor, and there’s no doubt from the nose that you’re dealing with an ultra-mature whisky. like going in to meet your aged grandfather who is sitting in his library surrounded by old books, with a little sunlight filtering through the drapes. in time, there’s dried peach and envelope gum. the palate is wooded and concentrated, but it is dry and lacking in the required energy. water stirs it into life, but kills the flavor. £450"
"john mcdougall's selection (distilled at bladnoch), 15 year old, 55.8%",Single Malt Scotch,83,110,"the only distillery-approved bottling of bladnoch in the united states. when compared to the gordon & macphail bottling above, this one isn’t as sweet or creamy in texture. there’s more citrus fruit and a drier, spicier finish. this one is also bolder and a bit more aggressive. 
"
"bowmore 'wine cask matured', 1992 vintage, 16 year old, 53.5%",Single Malt Scotch,83,120,"aged for six years in bourbon casks, then aged an additional ten years in bordeaux wine casks. classic bowmore peat smoke and red berried fruit (raspberry, strawberry) are the main components of this whisky, with additional notes of plum, grape skin tannins, currant, caramel, and marzipan. good grip from the limousin oak (wine casks). some brine and damp cellar notes emerged occasionally, with the smoke lingering long on the finish.
"
"signatory (distilled at bowmore), 11 year old, 1999 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,55,"aged in a used bourbon barrel. rather soft for bowmore — especially for its age — with a gentle foundation of honey, vanilla, and malt. interwoven notes of summer fruit, coconut, lime, and gentle peat, with teasing brine and smoke on the finish. a straightforward, unpretentious, pleasant bowmore.

"bruichladdich 20 year old, 3rd edition, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,170,"finished in madeira casks. an interesting contrast to the 15 year old. this one is more challenging than soothing (and quite dry too -- especially on the palate), with dominant red fruit (currant, raspberry, strawberry), plum, baked cinnamon apple, polished leather, bourbon, almonds, and just the hint of smoke and brine. dry, resinous finish. an intense laddie."
"bruichladdich 20 year old 'second edition', 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,170,"a departure from the first edition of bruichladdich 20 year old, and very glenmorangie-esque-given that it was aged for five weeks in mourvedre wine casks before being bottled. the wine influence is evident, both in appearance (a pinkish hue), its palate (berry fruits), and even its nickname (""flirtation""). it is quite a sweet bruichladdich, with chewy toffee, ripe berries, background pit fruits, and earthy/ resinous spicy notes-especially on the finish. a bruichladdich fresh islay sea breeze character fights its way through, but it is a struggle. 
"
"blackadder 'raw cask' (distilled at bruichladdich), cask #841, 1986 vintage, 54.4%",Single Malt Scotch,83,180,"a very fruity “laddie,” flowing with tangerine, apricot, pineapple and pear. background notes of honey, vanilla, and a wisp of smoke. the typical bruichladdich fresh, appetizing, brine notes are restrained, emerging ever so subtly on the finish. nicely rounded and clean throughout. 
"
"bruichladdich, 12 year old, 2nd edition, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,60,"a replacement to the original 10 year old, which is now off the market. a clean, straightforward dram with a lightness and freshness which is very inviting. notes of vanilla cream, light caramel, tropical fruit (coconut, pineapple), clementine, pear, and a hint of currant. appetizing, subtly briny finish.
"
"bruichladdich, 12 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,50,"finished in a rum cask. gold with a greenish tinge. notes of ripe barley, demerara sugar, toasted marshmallow, and sultana, with underlying vanilla and subtle brine emerging on the finish. a pleasant, easy-going laddie. (bottled for bayway world of liquor)
"
"bruichladdich links, torrey pine, 15 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,85,"the 8th in a series of “links” releases. this one’s further enhanced in chateau latour bordeaux casks. bright, fruity notes of red raspberry, rhubarb, and candy apple. teasing fresh brine emerges occasionally, along with citrus, mango, and vanilla. a very perky whisky. 
"
"the whisky exchange elements of islay br2 (distilled at bruichladdich), 49.3%",Single Malt Scotch,83,88,"the second bottling from bruichladdich in this range shows the ‘traditional‘ side of a distillery that is famed for the variety of its expressions. this, in other words, is bruichladdich in its sweet, honeyed, gentle guise partnered with american oak to produce a mashed banana character, an unctuous palate, and a light touch of almond on the finish. lovely. £55 (500 ml)"
"bruichladdich micro provenance 2007 (cask 14), 63.6%",Single Malt Scotch,83,117,"the micro provenance series is bruichladdich’s web-exclusive range of single cask bottlings. this is made from barley grown on rockside farm (now owned by kilchoman) and has been aged in virgin oak. the oak doesn’t dominate the nose, allowing fresh cereal sweetness to develop, along with an estery lift and some jasmine/meadowsweet florals. the palate is where creamy vanilla and white chocolate show through. fresh, balanced, and bottled at the right time. (468 bottles) £90"
"berry bros. & rudd (distilled at bunnahabhain) 23 year old 1989, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,138,"our second bunna’, this is pale of hue with a surprising hint of salinity alongside a whiff of lemon sherbet, and an aroma like wet linen, while a floury maltiness runs below. age however has twisted the fruits into the verge of musty over-ripeness. it’s explosive and spicy and, even though this is only 46%, it is hot. water picks up the acidity before there’s a huge hit of warming ginger as the kiss-off.  £89"
"bn6 elements of islay (distilled at bunnahabhain), 56.9%",Single Malt Scotch,83,84,"very chewy. think of melting mars bars, with a touch of coconut cream, then red-fruit acidity, red cherry, and lemon. all very forward and sweet, but with no alcohol when neat, showing an active cask. dilute, there’s coconut, pea shoots, and banoffie pie. the palate is thick with jaffa cake (orange and chocolate), then nutty granola. it doesn’t take water too well. quite fat. £50/500 ml"
"gordon & macphail (distilled at caol ila), cask #00/3454, 15 year old, 1991 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,85,"one of a series of single cask, wine-finished caol ilas. this one is finished in a claret (bordeaux) wine cask. the claret adds some bright red fruit notes (raspberry, red currant) and red licorice to accompany the smoke, brine, olive, and vanilla-laced malt. i have tasted some claret/bordeaux wood-finished whiskies where the wine was too dominant, but this one achieves a nice balance. 
"
"murray mcdavid (distilled at caperdonich) 1968, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,150,"style: speyside single malt scotch color: pale gold aroma: surprisingly fresh and clean. golden raisins, lightly oaky. malted barley. palate: beautifully balanced and clean. layers of fruit interwoven through a richly malty foundation. long and clean on the finish with a hint of dry oaky spiciness. 
"
"signatory 'un-chillfiltered' (distilled at clynelish), 13 year old, 1991 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,45,"very pale in color, suggesting it was aged in a used bourbon cask. one nosing confirms it. a fairly light, fresh, and appetizing whisky, with notes of brine, mustard seed, and delicate honeyed vanilla. slightly oily in texture. seaweed, with suggestions of ginger and bourbon on the finish. an aperitif whisky, or with sushi perhaps? (bottled exclusively for binny’s beverage depot.) 
"
"deanston, 30 year old, 46.7%",Single Malt Scotch,83,265,"aged in bourbon and sherry casks, and then finished off in oloroso sherry casks for two years. the sherry provides a good measure of lush fruit, brown sugar, and a slick texture on the palate. the sherry is clean and uncluttered, if somewhat overshadowing the traditional deanston honeyed malt foundation. i’m also picking up some burnt marmalade, lemongrass, and ginger. soft, sweet, fruity, finish. 
"
"deanston 18 year old, 46.3%",Single Malt Scotch,83,135,"this 18 year old was matured in refill hogsheads before a period of finishing in first-fill bourbon casks. it is non-chill filtered. the nose is light and fruity with pears, melon, and mild vanilla, plus caramel and a hint of toffee. rich and full on the textured palate, with big orchard fruits, honey, buttery spice notes, then emerging aniseed. dries in the finish, with plain chocolate and slightly tannic oak notes, plus a sprinkling of chili heat."
"scott's selection (distilled at glen elgin), 1980 vintage, 44.1%",Single Malt Scotch,83,140,"a mouth-coating -- almost chewy -- glen elgin, chock full of toffee, nut paste, heather-honey, and a hint of milk chocolate. the richness is brightened with ginger and mandarin orange, making for a pleasurable, soothing experience."
"duncan taylor (distilled at glen grant) 1972 vintage, 31 year old, 56.1% abv",Single Malt Scotch,83,155,"i don’t normally like to add water to old whiskies, but this one needs a little at this strength. whether you will like this whisky or not depends on whether you like woody whiskies with lots of sherry, and whether you care at all about recognizing the distillery character. the flavors are nicely balanced, rich, and very soothing in nature, but i struggle to find glen grant in here. ripe fallen fruit, chewy toffee, maple syrup, honey-glazed almonds, damp oak resins-it’s all there, and it’s all balanced and quite entertaining. i personally want to taste the distillery character in my whisky. if that didn’t matter to me, i would have given this whisky a higher score. 
"
"hart brothers (distilled at glen grant), 29 year old, 1972 vintage, 53.6%",Single Malt Scotch,83,160,"like many older glen grant offerings, this one is from a sherry cask. the sherry, and the long oak aging, transforms what is normally a light and easy drinking whisky to a more serious affair. ripe, heavy fruit dominate the palate-the sherry is very evident here, but it is not cloying. it’s quite nutty too, along with polished oak and toffee. the oak balances the sherry notes very nicely, and the whisky is clean and uncomplicated throughout, all the way through to its finish. 
"
"cadenhead’s (distilled at glen grant) 15 year old, 55.8%",Single Malt Scotch,83,100,"as this is slightly closed when neat, you have to search for glen grant’s classic apple notes behind a tense nose which, even with water, remains inward-looking. thankfully, this changes on the tongue with pure, very linear (typical of gg) flavors of cool mint, cucumber, basil, and yes, apple. easy-going from a relaxed cask, but with more substance than you’d expect."
"glencadam the rather enriched oloroso finish 14 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,73,"oloroso finish has spent 16 months gaining additional maturation in oloroso casks. the use of sherry wood has lent the nose a greater sweetness, with vanilla, dates, apples, and cinnamon. floral, spicy notes, with toffee, ginger, and sweet sherry on the palate, giving extra body and resonance. the fruity finish is of medium length, with mixed spices and white pepper. £45"
"exclusive malts 1991 (distilled at glencadam), 50.4%",Single Malt Scotch,83,160,"a 22 year old glencadam; maturation took place in a refill american oak hogshead. the nose offers rich honey and malt notes, though slightly balsamic. syrup-like on the palate, heathery and spicy, with more honey. relatively long and spicy in the finish, with chili, though honey persists right to the end. (u.s. only)"
"murray mcdavid mission iv (distilled at glendronach), 1974 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,210,"an interesting whisky, with flavor notes i wouldn’t normally find together-golden raisins, green grapes, plum, citrus tang, fresh ginger, almonds, and a hint of mint leaves, all wrapped by a pleasing maltiness with underlying notes of vanilla custard. fairly dry, slightly hot finish. many of the glendronachs (especially from the distillery) are sherried. some of the sherried versions, like the 33 year old, are excellent. however, this is a refreshing change of pace. i’m glad they bottled it when they did though, as any additional oak dryness would be detrimental. 
"
"glendronach, 1971 vintage, 39 year old, oloroso cask #489, 48.8%",Single Malt Scotch,83,592,"this whisky is doddery and on the edge, bordering on feeble. you have to look hard to find its spark and fire, but if you search for it, it is there. the nose is light and savory, with crushed fall leaves and chestnut on the nose. on the palate, there are traces of licorice stick, a touch of cumin, anise, and a creamier, less bitter chocolate note than some other samples. it finishes with traces of mandarin, but overall the sun is setting and the spirited and energetic man of old seems to be getting bitter. overall, though, still pretty impressive for its age. £380 "
"glendronach, 1989 vintage, 20 year old, pedro ximenez puncheon cask #3315, 53.2%",Single Malt Scotch,83,125,"this is the most seasonal of this batch of glendronachs, with a nose of rich stewed prunes and fermenting fruit in an orchard at harvest time. there is some anise and cherry lozenge in the mix, too, and the palate is complex, with plums, stewed fruits, and damson jam. the finish is drying, dusty, and spiky. £80 "
"the singleton of glendullan, 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,83,36,"clean, fragrant, and quite fruity, with notes of tangerine, lemon, pineapple, and kiwi. there's a creamy-almost oily-vanilla maltiness on the palate that binds the fruit together. gently dry, subtly spicy finish. a pleasing, unpretentious whisky."
"glenfiddich, snow phoenix, 47.6%",Single Malt Scotch,83,90,"second of this pair of limited editions from glenfiddich. this was named after a number of the distillery’s warehouse roofs collapsed under the weight of snow in 2010. this was a bottling of a selection of casks — ex-sherry, ex-bourbon, refill — from one of those damaged warehouses. it is gentle and sweet — cooked pear, fruit crumble topped with rolled oats, golden syrup, and on the palate hints of raisin. a lemon finish adds a freshness to a dangerously drinkable dram. "
"glen garioch wine cask matured 1998, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,83,155,"a 15 year old glen garioch which is unique as the first from the distillery to be fully matured in french bordeaux wine casks. the casks in question are tonneaux de vin rouge from saint-julien, and distillation took place on june 23, 1998. just 450 cases are available globally. sweet berries on the early nose, with milk chocolate, ginger, and spicy oak. malt, ginger, plums, and honey on the rich palate, while the long finish offers spicy malt and honey."
"glenglassaugh, 44 year old, 1960 vintage, 41.7%",Single Malt Scotch,83,900,"very frail. don’t add any water to this whisky, as its flavors seem to crumble. it’s a subtle whisky too -- one has to tease the flavors out of it. but when you do, with some focus, you’ll find fragrant notes of dried spice, malty vanilla, citrus peal, and elegant floral notes. surprisingly, the whisky is not overly dry and woody on the palate. the initial impression of this whisky is that it’s too tired and past its prime. with continued exploration and patience, its subtle pleasures emerge."
"glenkinchie, 12 years old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,83,50,"glenkinchie goes from 10 to 12 years old. i think the two years have done it good. it’s deeper, more complex, with better flavor development. notes of fresh cut grass, vanilla, bright lemon, and cinnamon, with a soft malt underbelly. so many people (myself included) would rather have seen rosebank as the lowland representative of the classic malts than glenkinchie. but this is a step towards bridging the gap. 
"
"cask & thistle (distilled at glenlivet), 30 year old, 1973 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,100,"its deep amber/ruby color suggests a lot of sherry, and one whiff confirms. the whisky is rich and sappy in texture, with lush notes of ripe sherry fruit balanced by dry, mature spicy oak. there’s a pleasant soothing texture to the whisky too, but i do struggle to find the subtle complexities which make some bottlings of glenlivet so special. there’s just so much oak and sherry dominating. at its best after dinner or with a cigar. 
"
"gordon & macphail private collection: the glenlivet decades 1991, 54.4%",Single Malt Scotch,83,156,"a quintet of releases showing examples of the glenlivet from five decades, issued to support the glenlivet generations 70 year old bottling. all are available individually or in a limited edition set (50 only) for £2,850; these bottlings are not currently available in the u.s.

the youngest of the quintet has been aged in refill sherry hogsheads, but the coconut that immediately assails the nostrils suggests they were made from american oak. alongside this is the distillery’s signature pineapple note which sits under a scented, floral lift. water adds a further layer of ripe pear. the palate is equally heightened with a powdery feel. it’s pretty discreet and i’d be cautious with any dilution. the finish is a mix of night-scented stocks, custard, and green apple. £95 "
"kirkland signature (distilled at glenlivet) 40 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,83,700,"bottling of a large package of 12 butts and 30 hoggies dating from 1972. the nose is slightly closed initially, but shows good mature distillery character: old apple, potpourri, more raspberry, and furniture polish. the palate is a little dry, with humidor and light chocolate, but needs water to bring out the fruit-sugar sweetness. it’s good, but that low bottling strength has sapped it of the energy which is vital for old whiskies. (u.s. only) "
"glenlivet nadurra islay cask, 61.5%",Single Malt Scotch,83,89,"the aim here was to recreate the style of malt made by george smith, but rather than running peated malt, chivas bros. has aged the spirit in islay casks (not what george would have done). on the upside, this is a classic nadurra: estery fruits with pineapple to the fore, freesia, pear, and fresh apple, the smoke giving subtle gun-flint notes to the palate. i like it as a dram, but it’s wimped out of what was intended. marked accordingly."
"glenrothes 2001 (bottled 2012), 43%",Single Malt Scotch,83,67,"a typical rothes nose, with vanilla, granola, apple, brazil nut, lemon, and
low-level sweet spices mixing with lightly oxidized fruits. that said, it needs
water, especially for the palate, where the malty crispness of the undiluted
taste is replaced by something more considered, darkly fruity and gently spicy;
coriander is uppermost. all in all, this is rothes in very approachable rather
than dynamic guise. one for a lazy afternoon."
"glenturret sherry edition, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,73,"principally matured in bourbon casks, this expression has undergone a finishing period in sherry casks. sweet wood polish on the nose, with brief pineapple juice notes and rosehip syrup. smooth and fruity on the palate, with vanilla, spicy milk chocolate, sultanas, and some earthiness. the finish is medium in length, with sherry and a tang of bitter orange. £47"
"highland park, 31 year old, 1974 vintage, cask #8998, 45.4%",Single Malt Scotch,83,440,"pleasant aroma (subtle, but with nice depth), with notes of honeyed lime, kiwi, chopped nuts, chocolate fudge, and gentle, seasoned tobacco. everything is working nicely on the palate too, with a similar flavor profile (the nuts now being roasted) and some smoldering smoke, until about mid-palate, when its age becomes evident with some wet wood notes blending in the mix through to the finish. (exclusive to virginia abc.) 
"
"highland park svein, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,83,51,"named after the viking chieftain whose exploits are central to the orkneyinga saga, svein is the least typically highland park of the initial three warrior releases. the nose is oily, with starch and ozone, then ultimately freshly-squeezed orange and lemon juice. the palate offers a suggestion of smoke, sawdust, and vanilla. nutty and slightly peppery in the finish, with just a suggestion of peat. €40/liter"
"highland park ambassador's choice 10 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,90,"originally exclusive to the swedish market, this expression was selected by highland park’s danish brand ambassador martin markvardsen. matured in a combination of 70% bourbon barrels and 30% oloroso sherry casks. waxy and malty on the early nose, with fresh earth, damp moss, vanilla, and honey. gentle peat on the palate, more earthy notes; herbal, with lime and salt. the finish is quite short, showing apricots, slight peatiness, allspice."
"berry bros. & rudd (distilled at imperial) 17 year old 1995, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,93,"the news that there’s a new distillery being built on the imperial site is something to be celebrated. one hopes that the new plant makes whisky of the same character as the old, because imperial is a classic single malt which is about fragrance (here pineapple and toasted marshmallows) and a clinging, seductive, cream soda quality. whiskies like these are poems, they need you to concentrate. this is a touch rigid, but that’s a minor criticism of a gorgeous dram.  £60"
"inchmurrin 18 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,111,"the nose offers less rich, peachy fruit than the 12 year old. more perfumed, with toasted marshmallows. silky and sweet on the palate, with tinned pears and pineapple, plus developing toffee and oak. the finish is quite long, with persistent ginger, drying slightly. £77"
"lagavulin 12 year old (diageo special release 2014), 54.4%",Single Malt Scotch,83,130,"typically pale and slightly broader than in previous years, with a little more fleshiness that rubs alongside squid ink and white pepper. huge smoke mingles with the sharp tang of brine and a touch of bran. water brings out lanolin. there’s little oak getting in the way of the distillery character here and while water settles the waves, it just doesn’t have the extra dimension that elevates the decent to the great. it does make a great highball tho’. (31,428 bottles)"
"signatory (distilled at laphroaig), 7 year old, 1999 vintage, 58.0%",Single Malt Scotch,83,45,"tastes more mature than its age would suggest. it’s packed with ripe, sweet barley (especially at the palate entry). there are some high citrus fruit notes and anise that emerge before the signature laphroaig peat smoke and tar wallops you. very vibrant and youthful, but without being too green. a steal for $45. (a binny’s beverage depot exclusive.) 
"
"ledaig, 10 year old, 46.3%",Single Malt Scotch,83,49,"tobermory’s peated offering. great to see ledaig hitting its stride, with a brisk punch of peat and not chill-filtered. there’s a bit of a raw edge too, quite bracing but still plenty of soothing sweetness. earthy peat smoke, ripe barley, honeyed vanilla, bourbon barrel char, black licorice stick, espresso bean, olive brine, and suggestions of beef jerky. in some respects, it even tastes younger than 10 years old, but i’m balancing that with bonus points for distinctiveness. "
"duncan taylor 'rarest of the rare' (distilled at linlithgow), cask #2214, 21 year old, 1982 vintage, 63.5%",Single Malt Scotch,83,220,"spicy and botanical on the nose, with notes of ginger, juniper, lemon grass, orange, and grapefruit rind. similar follow-through on the palate, with added notes of vanilla, honeyed malt, and hay. gentle, dried herb and spice finish. certainly some interesting -- perhaps even peculiar -- flavors from this product of the demolished lowland distillery."
"gordon & macphail (distilled at linkwood) 15 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,83,80,"a catch-up rather than a new release, but a fascinating contrast to the 14 year old flora & fauna bottling. yes, there’s apple blossom, but here there’s more medlar, fruit syrups, raspberry, and an intriguing play between vanilla and lightly oxidized nuttiness. linkwood’s substance is shown on the palate, where an oily feel adds texture to the lush dried fruits and saffron-led spiciness. best neat. an elegant dram.  "
"douglas laing old malt cask series (distilled at littlemill) 21 year old, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,83,137,"matured in a refill hogshead, the out-turn was 262 bottles. the nose is malty, with the oiliness of figs, plus dates and tinned peaches. supple on the palate, with vanilla, honey, and spicy resin notes. the finish is medium in length, warming, and slightly herbal, with nutmeg and malt. £90"
"murray mcdavid (distilled at lochside) 1981, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,76,"antique gold color. fruity aroma with delicate notes of spice (anise, eucalyptus). more fruit on the palate-soft in texture and gently sweet-with interwoven fresh spice notes and a pleasing rounded finish. a gentle, medium-bodied dram. 
"
"longrow c.v., 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,75,"a combination of 6, 10, and 14 year old longrow. i was concerned that there would be too much young whisky in here (like there was with the springbank c.v. several years ago), but this isn’t the case. youthful? yes. immature? no. a longrow with an attitude. creamy, sweeter vanilla notes up front, with kiln smoke, sea-soaked stone, tar, anise, chocolate fudge, and apricot. i would like to see more of the older whisky in here, because it leans towards the young side, but it is still a vibrant, enjoyable whisky. 
"
"gordon & macphail (distilled at longmorn), 15 year old, 1989 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,65,"a nicely clean longmorn, expressing floral notes (especially violets) and bright fruit (lemon, lime, cantelope, plums), supported interwoven notes of honey, rich malt, bread pudding, dates and vanilla. the classic longmorn viscosity is there, and this thickness is tamed by a very pleasing spicy, dry oak finish, with a hint of salt. i could drink this stuff anytime. g&m’s move to 46% has certainly benefited this whisky. (bottled exclusively for binny’s beverage depot.) 
"
"single malts of scotland (distilled at longmorn) 1990, 48.1%",Single Malt Scotch,83,121,"longmorn is one of speyside’s fruit bombs, something which remains true here, even if in slightly paler guise than usual. instead of ripe autumn fruits, here you get kiwi, william pear, green plum, even green tomato, and a faint blossom reminiscent of the almond notes of sakura (cherry blossom). i’d keep water well away, such is this light, lacy longmorn’s fragility. £73"
"duncan taylor (distilled at longmorn) 18 year old, 51.6%",Single Malt Scotch,83,190,"oak-driven, with cream and butterscotch dominating the nose initially. then there’s black cherry, and coriander seed frying in butter. the weighty distillate adds depth, but not specific flavors. the palate is all coconut cream, cream toffee, then longmorn’s cooked plum density comes in. i’d have preferred the oak to be scaled back, allowing the distillate to show, but if you’re looking for a scotch made for bourbon lovers, then go no further."
"signatory (distilled at macallan), 14 year old, 1990 vintage, cask #16294, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,70,"aged in a refill butt, and very pale in color. very fragrant -- fruity and spicy -- with notes of vanilla, lemongrass, ginger, sultana, citrus zest, key lime, and green grapes. there’s a floral component, too (rose petals?). a very delicate macallan, and quite suitable as an aperitif. (749 bottles produced.)"
"the macallan fine oak, 10 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,83,44,"a nicely honeyed malty foundation is balanced by fruit on the front of the palate, with a pleasingly dry, spicy finish. it would benefit by being bottled at 43%, like the older two expressions. it is simple, straight-forward, and unpretentious, as one would expect in a 10 year old whisky. 
"
"the macallan whisky maker's edition, 42.8%",Single Malt Scotch,83,90,"full gold. oily in texture, with ripe barley, front-loaded toffee, honey-drenched citrus, fallen orchard fruit, and a full complement of spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove). gripping, resinous, slightly hot finish. the flavors don’t meld together here as well as the other three expressions, but it’s still a fun ride. (price is per 1 litre). 
"
"macallan masters of photography 3rd release 1995 cask #14007, 59.6%",Single Malt Scotch,83,2750,"with the hue of pigeon blood (a ruby, not a dead bird), initially this seems closed, but richness develops, mixing stewed assam tea, chocolate biscuit, raisin, damson jam, and a whiff of tomato puree. the oak gives it the character of a barolo chinato. a knife and fork are needed to consume it, but for all the big tannins, there’s dark rose petal and the bittersweet edge of licorice. dry, rich, and hermetic. for the hardcore sherry lover. 145 bottles.   "
"macallan amber, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,83,70,"soft fruits are to the fore here; think of cooking green plums, fruit syrup, a hint of sultana to add to the sweetness, and then a hint of beeswax. there’s even a little of macallan’s occasional earthiness, here akin to the damp sand floor of a sherry bodega. this is the transition point in the range with a similar weight to gold but greater sweetness and the beginnings of macallan’s mysterious savory edge. have neat, with water, or ice. £45"
"macallan gold, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,83,56,"clean with the warming, sensual aroma of yeasty freshness that you get from freshly-baked bread. stir in some almond butter, a little hay. the palate shows that it has substance behind this very open nose. here is thickness, tongue-clinging oils, and a vibrant lemon note bringing to mind boiled travel sweets, before the dry maltiness comes through. with water — and it’s best lightly diluted — we’re looking at pastries. £36"
"macallan coronation cask american oak #190950, 58.1%",Single Malt Scotch,83,567,"bottled at 350 ml as a pair with a spanish oak version (and probably sold out at source), here you get the merest glimpse of macallan’s meatiness (shepherd’s pie) before flowers and apple blossom take charge. lifted, yes, but never delicate. water brings out cereal and mealy pudding, with barley sugar on the end. £350 (one of two 350 ml bottles)"
"master of malt darkness! macallan 15 year old px cask finish, 52.3%",Single Malt Scotch,83,185,"the darkness! series involves finishing in specially-made octave (50-liter) casks. this has positive macallan character with some oil (putty even) and touches of malt and turned earth, but also a scented, cognac-like fruitiness with added spice. water adds a little sherried cheesiness. the palate shows some nutty, oxidized flavors to begin with, but then in the middle the px flumps onto the tongue, slowing and dampening the drive. pleasant enough though. £110/500 ml"
"miltonduff 19 year old, 51.3%",Single Malt Scotch,83,63,"one in a trio from chivas bros., who every year release limited editions of 500 ml cask strength bottlings from a selection of its estates. these are predominantly only for sale on site or by mail order through www.maltwhiskydistilleries.com.

miltonduff was licensed in 1824, and these days is also an important blender’s malt with a little more oily depth than its neighbor, glenburgie. this has a deep floral bouquet — think iris and lily — and aromatic fruits like quince. with water there’s moss, sage, and orange peel. the fruity character is dominant in the mouth and becomes more tropical; there’s even some coconut on the finish. £40 "
"gordon & macphail (distilled at miltonduff) cask no. 9461, 56.3%",Single Malt Scotch,83,97,"turns quite murky with water, but don’t let this scare you off. fragrant and flowery on the nose. a sweet whisky with a honeyed malt and creamy vanilla foundation, a mélange of tropical fruit (mandarin, lime, pineapple), and soft oak on the finish. pleasant enough, but i wish the flavors were crisper, cleaner, and more well-defined. (a park avenue liquor exclusive.) "
"whisky galore (distilled at old pulteney), 16 year old, 1989 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,70,"lightweight, with a slightly oily texture. appetizingly fresh and briny on the palate, with underlying notes of hay, lime, vanilla-tinged malt, and a hint of seaweed on the finish. a mouth-watering aperitif. 
"
"springbank c.v., 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,40,"a marriage of whiskies from bourbon, sherry, and port casks, which does help give it some complexity. a bit fleshy on the nose (sooty peat, soy sauce, sherry, tannins). it calms down on the palate (and is soothed by the sherry notes), with some additional vanilla, bitter orange, and brine. more brine and warming pepper on the finish. there’s a lot going on here, which i like, but i’m not sure all the flavors dovetail with each other well enough to deserve a higher rating. "
"tomatin, 15 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,83,40,"a new expression in the portfolio. quite fruity, with prominent honey-tinged citrus peel, nutty toffee, nougat, and vanilla fudge, leading to a gripping, firm, dry oak resin finish. deeper and bolder than the 12 year old expression. "
"tomatin cask strength edition, 57.5%",Single Malt Scotch,83,73,"this is tomatin’s first cask strength offering, and is also non-chill filtered. the initial batch of 15,000 bottles was released in february, and was matured in a mix of oloroso and bourbon casks. the nose showcases ginger, malt, jaffa oranges, almonds, and melon, while the pleasingly viscous palate offers caramel, vanilla, warm leather, and chocolate-coated lime creams. long and gently spicy in the drying finish. (worldwide except u.s.) £50"
"tullibardine, 1993 vintage, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,83,55,"this highlander is lowland-ish in style, but with more heft. there’s soft barley sweetness, notes of vanilla and orange creamsicle. grassy notes emerge from time to time. it is clean and very drinkable. an ideal aperitif, but could be enjoyed anytime between dawn and dinner. whoever said whisky was an after-dinner drink never tasted this whisky. 
"
"tullibardine john black 6 single cask 1993, 55.1%",Single Malt Scotch,83,180,"john black is the veteran master distiller at tullibardine distillery, and this is the sixth release to bear his name. the single malt in question was matured in bourbon barrel #10,002. lemonade, dough, and maple on the nose. progressively more floral, parma violets, pear drops, a hint of cinnamon, and milk chocolate in time. hazelnuts and allspice on the palate, while citrus fruits emerge, plus more milk chocolate and a suggestion of cloves. medium length, with nuts and oak.  £115"

"
"the antiquary, 12 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,83,30,"floral aroma with a lively array of orchard fruit and citrus.  underlying notes of soft honey and vanilla.  good malt foundation for a blend.  an elegant and breezy ""anytime"" dram.
"
"eades highland 'double malt', 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,83,70,"a marriage of ben nevis (85%) and clynelish (15%). a weighty whisky. not as nimble as the speyside expression below, but with flavors that linger. rummy toffee notes, roasted nuts, earthy moss, jammy fruit, teasingly subtle black strap molasses, and clove. 
"
"wemyss malts ‘lemon grove’ (distilled at cragganmore) 1989 (bottled 2011), 46% ",Single Malt Scotch,83,119,"cragganmore is a whisky that typically needs time before it starts to get going and which then goes through many changes on its journey to its complex, layered apogee. here it is at a slightly contradictory midpoint. the nose is fragrant and fruity: apricots, stewed apple, and yes, lemon; and, with water, a hint of smoke. the palate meanwhile shows more of the earthy depth and sloe berry richness that will slowly emerge. a pleasing dram, nonetheless. £75"
"wemyss malts (distilled at bunnahabhain) 1991 oysters with lemon pearls, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,154,"light gold with a very fresh and slightly ozonic nose that brings to mind thai herbs: lemongrass, galangal, as well as lime. just slightly nippy when neat. the palate is equally intense, but with a central sweetness. water cuts down this razor-sharp intensity, adding a softer mid-palate texture, while the finish remains slightly mineraly. a decent aperitif bunna. £97"
"wemyss malts (distilled at bunnahabhain) 1991 thread of smoke, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,164,"yes, it’s another 1991 bunna from wemyss, so check the name when purchasing. this one has a distinctly smoky element alongside the marine note which they both share. very light lemon, with water, then a hit that’s like walking into a high-class sushi joint. a zesty start with lots of angelica, and then sweetness with, when diluted, soft malt and light ginger on the palate. rock solid. £103"
"wemyss malts bench with a sea view (distilled at clynelish) 1997, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,104,"unusually, wemyss malts simultaneously offered two single cask bottlings of clynelish in october 2014, both distilled in 1997 and matured in hogsheads. ‘bench with a sea view’ provided an out-turn of 371 bottles. the nose is sweet and fruity, with green apples and chocolate mousse. slightly oily on the palate, with black pepper, salt, and orchard fruits. persistently peppery in the finish, with citrus fruit, oak, a hint of brine, and cocoa. £68"
"wemyss malts kirsch gateau (distilled at bunnahabhain) 1988, 56%",Single Malt Scotch,83,190,"polished rosewood. big sherried notes, but also generous sweetness. vermouth-like: dark fruits, a hint of spice, light oxidation, with some herbal edges and morello cherries. becomes balsamic. the palate is highly concentrated, with more cherry, but has this intense savory astringency. water is needed. the nose continues to be remarkable, all damask rose and resin, but dilution can’t eradicate the mouth-puckering quality. £130"
"wemyss malts spice king, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,83,54,"this nas version is a little smokier than before, with ground pepper, toasted coriander and fennel seeds, and a dusting of nutmeg. the mouthfeel is light initially; early orange and lime flavors are extinguished quickly. warm cocoa, malt, chocolate shavings, black cherry, raspberry bubblegum, and concentrated dark fruits complement restrained spices and faint smoke, followed by a hot, spicy cinnamon finish. it’s pretty decent, but the palate doesn’t quite match up to the promise of the nose. £37"
"wemyss malts vintage strawberry punnet (distilled at invergordon) 1988, 46%",Grain Scotch Whisky,83,125,"i’m playfully perplexed as to whether the titular “vintage” refers to an elderly strawberry or an aged punnet. undaunted, this example from the highland powerhouse noses much better than promised with fresh mint, small, tight strawberry buds, sandy loam, and a saccharine sweetness. it has a sweet, syrupy, fat flavor, in turn revealing caramel, buttery notes, white chocolate, vanilla, and black currant. a satisfying finish of browning butter and warm chestnuts. (242 bottles) £82"
"kilchoman machir bay 2013 release, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,60,"this year’s bottling mixes 4 and 5 year old bourbon casks with the younger element finished in oloroso, though this is hardly sherried. here is smoke, samphire, and kilchoman’s fleshy core giving echoes of 80s cuisine: scallops and white peaches anyone? watering shows sea-washed rock, light flowers, and hot sand. the palate is sweet, sour, and smoky, with a chalky edge and a peppery palate, but water releases blossom and a little gunsmoke: a duel in the dunes? £39"
"kilchoman 100% islay 4th edition, 59%",Single Malt Scotch,83,108,"a distillate of islay-grown barley, made in 2009-10 and aged in bourbon wood. here’s an intense kilchoman with a licorice root sweetness mixed with dried seaweed, machair (beach pasture), cereal, and herbal smoke. the palate is slightly oily and hot when neat, with a distinct mineral edge. water shows its youth but also allows tarragon and wormwood to develop. £64"
"royal lochnagar distillers edition 2000 (batch #rl/96-8s), 40%",Single Malt Scotch,83,78,"this 2012 limited edition from the deeside distillery of royal lochnagar underwent initial maturation in bourbon barrels before a period of finishing in muscat wine casks. the pleasing nose offers pears poached in dessert wine, heather, malt, and ginger. rich and rounded on the palate, with immediate soft, ripe peaches, then figs, ginger, and cloves. lengthy in the slightly nutty finish, with fruity spice notes."
"smoking ember, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,83,40,"big and smoky, but with a rich, balancing, malty underbelly. tarry rope, leafy bonfire, rooty peat, burnt licorice, smoked seaweed, coal ash, and vanilla-tinged malt, all with emerging brine, subtle spanish olive, and a hint of ginger. a robust, yet well-rounded, islay-style whisky with a pleasing oily texture, though i do wish it had a higher strength for a little more attitude."
"teaninich, 1996 vintage, 55.3%",Single Malt Scotch,83,325,"matured in a “rejuvenated american oak” cask. “ tropical fruit” is the operative descriptor here. bananas in cream, honey-kissed citrus (lime, clementine), papaya, mango, a hint of coconut, green tea, and gentle vanilla. soft finish. rather exotic. almost tries too hard to be cool. distinctive, but i could tire of it sooner than the others here. (246 bottles) £200"
"deerstalker, 18 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,100,"from the balmenach distillery. (the previous bottling of this whisky was from a sherry cask. this one is from a bourbon cask.) mouth-coating in texture. ripe barley and malty up front, ultimately transitioning to a clinging dryness towards the finish. notes of vanilla cream, toasted coconut, marshmallow, cut grass, honeydew melon, and lemon/lime. a pleasant, textural whisky. (bottling at 46% and not chill-filtered enhances this.) my question: why sherry cask or bourbon cask? i think a marriage of both types of cask would add more dimension and complexity."
"chieftain’s (distilled at glen moray), 1989 vintage, 18 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,83,90,"clean, simple, and straightforward: malty and smooth, with cut grass, hay, a kiss of honey, and a hint of gin botanicals. a nice whisky to introduce blend drinkers to the world of single malts."
"the black grouse alpha, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,83,45,"the famous grouse has been extended in various directions with varying degrees of success but for my money, this is the best and most logical. this is the version where the smoky, oily, spicy, and peaty notes of the original blend are brought more to the fore, but this works because married to it are grape and melon notes that ensure the grouse lands softly."
"speyburn arranta, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,61,"poor old speyburn. an unfairly overlooked malt simply because of its (too low) price. the use of more active casks here gives an almost waxed crayon nose, along with some sweet depth. in time, there are fresh green fruits, raspberry mousse, and beautiful floral intensity. water produces lemon. the palate is clean and quite light, but there’s a pool of fruits in the center giving a focal point. as water makes things (lemon) soapy, i’d have it neat. £40"
"singleton of dufftown 15 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,83,61,"diageo’s singleton range is its answer to the problem of how to build a global single malt brand when each distillery will ultimately be limited by its capacity. answer? a single brand: ‘singleton,’ but from three distilleries, each focused on a different area of the world. singleton of dufftown is europe’s expression, and this 15 year old combines cake mix, peanut butter, and fleshy fruits. there’s dried banana and vanilla on the palate, and a nutty sweet finish. £38 (not available in the u.s.)"
"singleton of glendullan 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,83,46,"the u.s. singleton comes from glendullan, a distillery that makes a sweet, light spirit. here, a percentage has been aged in ex-sherry casks, which has added a layer of fruity sweetness — think port-like sloe notes, muscatel, and wisteria. the wood is lightly handled, allowing the aromas full rein on the palate."
"singleton of glen ord 18 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,83,119,"one in the trio of age-stated singleton of glen ords, this 18 year old has a nose of sultanas, hazelnuts, sherry, vanilla, and a note of pine. silky on the full palate, with vanilla, milk chocolate, sherry, and caramel. the lengthy finish is drying, with licorice and chili. rm481"
"the singleton of glendullan master’s art, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,83,160,"glendullan has reimagined itself with a trio of travel retail exclusives. this, the most expensive, has been given some secondary maturation in muscat wine casks. it’s the most complex of the trio, with more citric elements, hints of hay, and some spice, while the richness and dried scented fruit of the muscat is a good accompaniment to the sloe-like side of the distillery character. a thick vanilla component helps the palate along to a chocolatey finish."
"master of malt single cask series (distilled at north british) 18 year old, 52.3%",Single Grain Whisky,83,100,"a tasty example from the historic north british distillery in edinburgh, with a bouquet of vanilla, sweet hay, and mint ice cream. a sip made me nostalgic for childhood candies such as sherbet-filled, fizzy flying saucers and prohibited ivory-white candy sticks. i was seized by the initial lemon zing of acidic tartness, which becomes creamier before a richer, candied peel taste appears. there’s a clean, sweet finish and the mint pops up with water. overall, satisfying but uncomplicated."
"the sovereign (distilled at cambus) 26 year old 1988, 46.9%",Single Grain Whisky,83,142,"a light golden dram from a refill hoggie, redolent of fragrant honey, custard slices, orange water, perfumed soaps, and fresh spring blossom. vanilla, dried peel, and shortbread petticoat tails on the palate, that develops with spun sugar flavors. the whole concoction is anchored by a little oak, but the cask has been gentle. the finish is mouth-drawing, but settles down like a well-sucked butterscotch. mellow and serene. (305 bottles) £91"
"double barrel laphroaig/mortlach, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,83,77,"this is one of the more intriguing of the double barrel series, because while the others either complement each other or don’t,
this has a depth to it that you need to look for. at first it’s all laphroaig, and the peat and sea burst out of the glass. but just as you’re asking yourself what the point is, the fruity notes of the mortlach cushion the whole landing and let you down gently. impressive. £48"
"grant's voyager, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,83,32,"molten blossom honey, almond milk puddings, and parma violets interlaced with a fine, drifting chimney smoke compose the nose of this new blend from william grant & sons. smooth, burnished orange and honey cough drops initially, then the flavor develops through more pronounced citrus and gentle spices to achieve a sweeter climax. the grain is quite evident in the harmony of the blend. the finish is long, more beeswax than honey, the sweetness finally depleted. (travel retail only) £20"
"house of hazelwood 21 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,83,98,"a spicier character to represent 1920s bombay (now mumbai) yields an intriguing nose of cumin, dried apple, cardamom, and roasted coriander seed, walnut shells, dry meat from the tandoor, and aged cigars in spanish cedar. a rather gluey texture with a dominant cinnamon note, interjected by spicy fruit from the european oak and gentle cloves. a short finish leaves a reverberation of spices and chicory root. the aromas are wonderful, but it comes unstuck with the mouthfeel. £75"
"that boutique-y whisky company (distilled at loch lomond) batch 1, 52.4%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,83,60,"rose petals, pomegranate, toasted coriander seeds, and glacé cherry mix it up with a tangle of bramley apple peelings. a medium weight grain whisky with a satiny texture. huge, throbbing, pulsating ginger kicks in at full strength. yowser! water knocks the fiery ginger out, but quells this loch lomond to a duller spice profile. a finish of ground almond, subdued gingerbread, and active spices. great nose, but i was hoping for greater versatility of flavor. £38"
"douglas laing old particular (distilled at bowmore) 18 year old, 60.1%",Single Malt Scotch,83,168,"the first thing to note is the strength. it’s surprisingly not that hot initially, rather there are hints of soft orchard fruits, gentle smoke, and seashells. with water, the fruits show up—mango and peach—but the alcohol is still masking things. water goes in immediately to produce a palate that is cool, slightly sweet, with seashore notes, wet stones, and those fruits, but there’s still a real tension to the whole experience. for the brave. £110"
"douglas laing old particular (distilled at dalmore) 1997, 55.5%",Single Malt Scotch,83,119,"this 17 year old refill hogshead-matured expression of dalmore was distilled in may 1997, and 237 bottles have been released. it is an interesting example of dalmore uncut, without the proprietary sherry maturation-spin usually put on it. the nose is sweet, with caramel, tinned peaches and pineapple, and a smearing of honey. zesty spices open the palate, which becomes nutty, with jaffa oranges, gingery oak, and dark chocolate. long and warming in the finish, with more oak and plain chocolate. £78"
"douglas laing provenanace (distilled at longmorn) 11 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,83,73,"pale straw. light but intense, with some pollen, dusty fruits, baked apple. water brings out an aroma like a fruit orchard in springtime. performs much better in the mouth, and although hot, shows good distillery character with some cooked peach, quince jam, and yellow plums. a decent lunchtime dram. £50"
"douglas laing old particular 10 year old (ledaig, distilled at tobermory), 48.4%",Single Malt Scotch,83,69,"this 10 year old peated expression from tobermory distillery on mull was matured in a single refill hogshead and bottled in january 2016. medicine chests, sweet smoke, ginger, and apple on the nose, with damp earth. the palate provides a big hit of peaty spice, seaweed, black pepper, ginger, and dark berries. becoming slightly bitter in the drying, ashy, medium-length finish.

"douglas laing old particular (distilled at invergordon) 28 year old 1987, 56.5%",Single Grain Whisky,83,110,"sweet top notes of brioche loaf with baking spices, but there are savory flavors of pastrami bark lurking deep in the glass. flavors of golden syrup and butterscotch unfurl beautifully from within the thick texture at cask strength. roasted spices explode, but as it dilutes, stewed fruits and sucked boiled candy notes are found. water emphasizes confectionary elements and purple fruits, but kills the spices stone dead. dry, spicy heat on the finish.

"exclusive malts speyside 10 year old 2003 cask #1781, 56.3%",Single Malt Scotch,83,90,"from an undisclosed speyside distillery. the nose is extraordinarily yeasty, with distinct apple cider backed by light caramel. the palate is more integrated than the nose with oak and cinnamon spice, apple, honey, and malt. at first these flavors are well balanced, but a spice and heat blast in the mid-palate throws things off. the finish reflects this and is quite dry. the parts are better than the whole in an interesting and strong whisky.  (u.s. only)"
"exclusive malts 2005 ledaig (distilled at tobermory), 57.6%",Single Malt Scotch,83,90,"bottled at 8 years of age as part of exclusive malts’ u.s. batch 5, this is a relatively youthful expression of the peated ledaig spirit produced at tobermory distillery. the nose is full-on and vibrant, with seaweed, brine, peat, black pepper, and new leather. the palate opens with a big punch of spicy peat, then sweet cereal notes and more black pepper. hot smoke and spice in the medium-length finish, with a hint of coal."
"the exclusive malts (distilled at tomatin) 10 year old 2004 (cask #2645), 57.4%",Single Malt Scotch,83,95,"matured solely in refill sherry casks, this whisky has a light, fruit-forward nose with nectarine, honey, malt, and a touch of spice. the entry is softer than you’d expect for the proof and it presents the fruit at the nose, along with salt and a dash of black pepper. the spice takes over in the mid-palate along with some heat, really throwing off the balance established in the entry. a light finish closes out a slightly disjointed taste experience. (u.s. only)"

"kirkland signature highland 18 year old sherry cask finish, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,83,33,"an 18 year old single malt for just $33 should set alarm bells ringing. but this sherry-finished kirkland expression from an undisclosed distillery is definitely a decent dram at a bargain-basement price. initially slightly vegetal and earthy on the nose, developing a warm leatheriness, with sherry, figs, melon skin, and caramel. silky on the palate, with milk chocolate, emerging hazelnuts, sweet sherry, and honey. the finish is medium in length, with spicy orange and mocha coffee notes."

"auchentoshan 32 year old, 1973 vintage, 55.5%",Single Malt Scotch,82,700,"whisky from two different sherry casks. the sherry, extra aging, and higher strength produce an intensely rich auchentoshan. fudgy caramel, toffee and cocoa notes are offset by golden raisin, apricot, and clementine. underlying notes of roasted nuts, old leather, and spice (vanilla, mint) peek through occasionally. an enjoyable whisky, but much of the auchentoshan is lost somewhere in all that oak and sherry. 
"
"balvenie madeira cask 21 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,82,212,"another travel retail exclusive, but what is a highly lucrative retail sector will inevitably demand items that shoppers can’t buy elsewhere. imagine balvenie port wood 21 year old, but with more sweetness; damson jam, blueberries, and a slight singed note before maple syrup calls in from the back. it’s big and rounded and, for me, just lacking the definition and complexity of the port wood. for sweeter tooths (teeth?) perhaps."
"ben nevis 1998, duncan taylor nc2 range, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,82,90,"initially mulch and damp undergrowth on the nose, with a whiff of sulfur. then developing soft toffee and vanilla notes, though the ‘outdoors’ odor remains. big and oily in the mouth, with a chewy texture. oak, citrus fruit, hazelnuts, and spices, plus a hint of gunpowder tea. medium to long in the finish, with more oak, ginger, and quite bitter coffee. a typically ‘off the rails’ independent ben nevis. great if you have a soft spot for a ‘bad boy!’ "
"master of malt darkness! benrinnes 15 year old px cask finish, 53.5%",Single Malt Scotch,82,101,"another benrinnes from the uk bottler’s new range, here the finish is more forceful, with masses of raisined sweetness, blueberry syrup, and molasses. the benrinnes character adds weight and a firm earthy base, but this is more cask driven, slightly grippy, and for all the richness of the px cask, the end result is a little bitter because of the treacle/molasses note. fun certainly, but a bit over the top. £60/500 ml"
"benromach peat smoke, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,82,75,"invigorating and youthful, with a raw edge to it. challenging notes of creosote, charred oak, and earthy peat fire dominate, with underlying ripe barley, honey, and caramel apple. aggressive, but not over the top.
"
"benromach, cask #613, 1999 vintage, 58.6%",Single Malt Scotch,82,50,"this cask-strength whisky turns cloudy with the addition of water. nice balance of both moderate sherry and smoke, with underlying fruit gum drops, shortbread, charcoal, black licorice, and subtle herbs. an assertive whiskey. the flavors aren’t as crisp as i would like, but pretty good for seven years old. (bottled exclusively for binny’s beverage depot)
"
"exclusive malts 1992 (distilled at bladnoch), 48.1%",Single Malt Scotch,82,150,"maturation for this 21 year old bottling of bladnoch occurred in a refill american oak hogshead. sweet orchard fruits, new-mown hay, malt, and soft toffee on the nose. the palate is initially fruity, with more malt, then nuttiness develops, with aniseed and black pepper. the finish is relatively short and tannic. (u.s. only)"
"cadenhead’s (distilled at bowmore) 11 year old, 57.5%",Single Malt Scotch,82,88,"light and very creamy, with very subtle smoke in the background, this is like eating a white chocolate ice cream while walking toward a distant beach barbecue. the palate is gentle and sweet with good, refreshing saline balance. water brings out mint. it’s just a little too tight and disconnected on the tongue."
"bruichladdich legacy two, 1965 vintage, 41.8% abv",Single Malt Scotch,82,465,"aged half in used bourbon barrels, half in refill sherry casks. thicker, more viscous, and with much more depth than the other three bruichladdichs reviewed here. the whisky oozes syrupy vanilla, marshmallow, caramel, and marzipan, accentuated by coconut and other tropical fruits. bruichladdich's signature freshness and brine emerges, but oh, so subtly. it finishes firmly dry and oaky, thanks to all those years in wood. initially this helps to cut some of the sweetish viscosity of this whisky, but it lingers a bit too long for my palate. i would like to have tried this whisky a few (or perhaps even several) years back."
"bruichladdich 'peat', 46%",Single Malt Scotch,82,65,"the most heavily peated of the three (35ppm phenol), but rather gentle for such smoke intensity. no doubt this is partly due to its sweet underbelly of vanilla cream puff, honeyed barley, and melon fruit. the other factor is that the smoke influence is not medicinal like some other islay whiskies, but rather more of a leafy bonfire smoke, with burning embers and teasing brine on the finish. like waves, peat comes across as a bit youthful.
"
"bruichladdich bere barley 2009, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,82,75,"using this ancient barley variety is a challenge for a distiller. the yields are low, the mash thick and hard to work, but i’m delighted that bruichladdich has persevered. it adds a more overt cereal note to the whisky, taking the laddie off into a different world of honey-nut corn flakes. there’s also a surprising rose-like perfume. it’s young, so add water to cut its more, er, bracing qualities. in fact, have it with ice and soda. (travel retail exclusive) £58"
"gordon & macphail (distilled at caol ila), 12 year old, 1991 vintage, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,82,60,"notes of smoked olives and an earthy peatiness wrapped inside layers of sweetness (honey, caramel and light toffee). the whisky is laced with seaweed and pepper for added zest, with a long smoky and peppery finish. it shows enough maturity, yet it is young enough to let the true caol ila character shine through. i would like to have seen this whisky bottled at a higher strength and not chill-filtered. 
"
"the dalmore, 1974 vintage, 42%",Single Malt Scotch,82,1250,"beautiful complex fruit on the nose. tannic grip on the palate -- especially on the finish. the tell-tale orange marmalade combines notes of orchard fruit, caramel apple, fried pineapple, banana nut bread, unsweetened chocolate, grape skin, and plain toast, peppered with cinnamon and ground espresso bean. distinctive and evolving on the palate -- and humming along quite nicely -- until the oak turns a bit austere and aggressive on the finish. for this reason, it’s my least favorite of the range."
"dalmore 1995 the distillery manager’s exclusive, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,82,135,"this 1995 vintage is exclusively available from whisky shop in the uk. the whisky was selected by distillery manager ian mackay and his team, and matured in matusalem sherry and american white oak casks. 1,800 bottles are available. worn leather, candied orange, malt, and cinnamon on the nose. spicy orange, sherry, mixed nuts, and licorice on the palate. the finish is slowly drying, with dark chocolate and smoky caramel notes. £85"
"exclusive malts (distilled at dalmore) 13 year old 2000 cask #6952, 53.5%",Single Malt Scotch,82,100,"remarkably pale in color, this exclusive malt is a rare peated dalmore. peat reads more funky barnyard than smoke on the nose, with just a touch of sweetness behind it. the taste is much better than the smell, with the addition of smoke to the peat, intertwined with honey, salt, citrus, and ginger spice. the finish is slightly acidic and dry, far less satisfying than the mid-palate. there’s a reason why dalmore doesn’t peat, but this release is still fascinating. (u.s. only)"
"dalmore valour, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,82,72,"initial maturation of valour takes place in first-fill bourbon casks, before a period in 30 year old matusalem oloroso sherry butts from gonzales byass. finally it is transferred to port pipes from the duoro region of portugal. the nose is floral, with sherry notes, ripe oranges, and marzipan, while the palate offers dark sherry, with bitter orange, contrasting chocolate-coated fudge, and gingersnaps. the finish is medium to long, with lively spices and berry bitterness. (travel retail only) price is per liter."
"deanston, 12 year old, 46.3%",Single Malt Scotch,82,55,"bottling at a higher proof without chill-filtering has improved the whisky, amplifying its subtle flavors. antique gold color. the flavors are bright and fresh, with notes of citrus, pineapple, lemongrass, and subtle ginger, all on a bed of clean honeyed malt, light toffee and soft vanilla. gentle, easy-going finish. a pleasant “any time of the day” dram.
"
"deanston virgin oak, 46.3%",Single Malt Scotch,82,32,"finished in virgin oak casks, so i would expect to find some wood influence here somewhere. indeed i do, particularly on the finish. there’s no age statement, but on the nose it comes across as a bit youthful. honeyed vanilla, lemon, pear, fresh-cut grass, and wood shavings on the nose. more of the same on the palate, with sweet notes to the fore, and virgin oak influence (wood shavings, polished leather, and a firm oak grip). very individualistic, but the flavors don’t seem fully integrated. (perhaps a bit more aging in non-virgin casks?)"
"deanston 20 year old oloroso, 55.3%",Single Malt Scotch,82,180,"this cask strength bottling has been matured in oloroso sherry casks. the nose offers old leather and a slightly vegetal note, along with ginger and developing toffee. the palate features unexpectedly dry sherry, rapidly giving treacle, plain chocolate, and dark spices. hot spices, with black pepper and raisins in the lengthy finish."
"edradour, cask #06/538/4, 1996 vintage, 11 year old, 57.5%",Single Malt Scotch,82,90,"a “straight from the cask” bottling, finished in a grand arôme rum barrel. i can really pick up the rum. if you’ve ever had rum from la reunion island (easiest to find in france), you immediately pick it out here. peculiar straw gold/lime green color. intriguing on the palate, too: botanicals, fennel, liqueur-ish, honeyed malt, red licorice, and tropical fruit. sort of like a cross between a scotch and something benedictine monks would make. a nice change of pace. (bottled for maxwell street trading co.)
"
"gordon & macphail single cask #5054 (distilled at glen grant) 1990 vintage, 56.0% abv",Single Malt Scotch,82,65,"here’s a whisky not seen very often in the u.s. when it is seen, it’s from one of the independent bottlers. i have always felt that younger glen grant whiskies make a nice introduction to the single malt category-especially for a blend drinker trading up. the whisky is usually light to medium in body and uncomplicated-with no harsh edges to be particularly offensive. and so it is with this whisky. a soft, cereal grain maltiness marries nicely with floral, delicately fruity notes throughout. gentle, dry but malty finish, with suggestions of shortbread cookies and vanilla. a nice representation of a younger glen grant. the flavors are clean and tight. 
"
"glen grant 170th anniversary, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,82,125,"four years ago glen grant was in a sorry state, its beautiful gardens in need of some love and attention, its malts neglected and seemingly unloved. then campari bought it and we have heard very little more since. that’s until now. with a new visitor center, the gardens in full bloom, and the owners determined to make it a major player, things are looking up. this limited edition 170th anniversary bottling is made up of vintages stretching back to the 70s. they include a couple of sherry butts and some peated spirit. the result is a rich malt with some buttery toffee notes at first, distinctive lemon and green apple notes, and a touch of aniseed. midway through, it sets off in a more feisty direction, with some peat, sharp spice, and green banana skin. beguiling and unusual, it’s a statement of intent from an iconic distillery — watch this space. (selected specialist outlets, excluding the u.s.) "
"glen scotia, 12 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,82,65,"initially fresh and briny -- the campbeltown signature being quite evident -- leading to chewy toffee, nutty notes. the brine emerges again -- this time with a hint of seaweed and smoke, followed by another wave of chewy toffee and nuts. the flavors stubbornly refuse to integrate fully, coming across on the palate individually and independently. sort of like consecutive solos, rather than harmony."
"glencadam the rather refined port wood finish 12 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,82,56,"this glencadam variant has been finished for 20 months in ruby port pipes. the result is a whisky that departs from its younger stablemate by offering a nose of rose petals, milk chocolate, stewed rhubarb, sweet red wine, and black pepper. the same ‘new paper’ note survives, however. viscous on the palate; initially strawberries, then spicy milk chocolate, caramel, and candied cherries. remaining sweet in the finish, with nutmeg and darker chocolate notes. £35"
"glendronach, 1978 vintage, 31 year old, oloroso cask #1040, 51.2%",Single Malt Scotch,82,288,"no doubt about it, we’re at the furthest outpost of glendronach’s territory here, and this particular cask has waved the white flag. it has a dense, sappy, and nutty nose which is very savory and not particularly attractive. but thankfully there’s more to welcome you on the palate, with some rich orange and red fruit and sweet candy providing balance to the savory notes, and gentle oak and hazelnuts also getting a look in. the finish is woody and pruney. £185 "
"glenglassaugh revival, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,82,55,"the first widely-available single malt from the revived distillery of glenglassaugh, revival comprises spirit from both first and refill casks, finished in first-fill oloroso sherry butts for a period of six months. initially a little mashy, with beer-like aromas. quite sweet and mildly sherried, with developing roasted malt notes, ginger, hazelnuts, and caramel. leather and insistent spice on the palate, majoring in nutmeg and cinnamon. straightforward in the finish; spicy and nutty. probably a crackerjack in another dozen years!"
"glenglassaugh octaves peated, 44%",Single Malt Scotch,82,72,"a relatively heavily-peated variant of glenglassaugh matured in 50-liter octave casks, giving significant cask influence due to the high surface-to-volume ratio. this expression is non-chill filtered. carbolic soap and a mineral note on the softly smoky nose, followed by apple pie and cream notes. the palate is medium-sweet and quite spicy, with black pepper. now clear, dry peat notes present themselves with a touch of chili. ashy peat and cinnamon in the medium-length finish. £55"
"the glenlivet nadurra oloroso, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,82,84,"i’m a fan of the original nadurra’s freshness, which maximizes glenlivet’s apple blossom and pineapple perfume. this pleasantly funky new brother has been matured wholly in oloroso, which adds (very) sweet sherry, nougat, blackcurrant, grilled pear, and malt. while the palate starts well, with mixed red and black fruits (and a little grapefruit), the sherry adds thickness from back palate on and the distillery slides away. pleasant, but a tale of two halves. (travel retail exclusive) £50 "
"the glenlivet founder’s reserve, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,82,44,"this new nas might surprise those who recall the chivas bros. “age matters” campaign, but that’s whisky for you. the initial impression is of a fresh maltiness, sweet hay, and fresh porridge oats, then comes sawn oak, but it opens into pineapple, becoming more obviously glenlivet. the palate is pretty and light, but seems a bit hollow in the middle, making the whole package slightly insubstantial. water enhances and sweetens the nose, but deepens that mid-palate hole. £30"
"gordon & macphail (distilled at glenlossie), 27 year old, 1978 vintage, cask #1815",Single Malt Scotch,82,90,"firm on the palate and quite mature. good balance with malty-toffee notes accented by dried oak spices. additional notes of roasted nuts, tobacco, earl grey tea, sandalwood, and a hint of peat and bacon fat. (260 bottles produced.) 
"
"murray mcdavid (distilled at glenlossie) 1975, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,82,150,"style: speyside single malt scotch color: bright gold aroma: fresh cut grass. damp grist. vanilla, marshmallow, and banana. palate: sweet malt initially, then quickly becoming dry, oaky, grassy, and spicy. big, long, dry, spicy finish. 
"
"glenmorangie burgundy wood finish, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,82,65,"the newest whisky in the regular stable of wood-finished whiskies for glenmorangie. very fruity-sometimes reminiscent of overripe fruit; other times cooked fruit. in the mix, there’s maple syrup, plum, almonds, and sweet barley notes. the whisky is peppered with spicy notes of toasted oak, cinnamon and vanilla. a whisky that is lush on the nose, chewy on the palate, with a finish of dried spices for balance. this whisky takes some getting used to, and it’s not an every day whisky. you’ll have to be in the right mood for it. 
"
"signatory (distilled at glenrothes), cask #1082, 12 year old, 1994 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,82,60,"very much in the glenrothes style, with a viscous texture that clings to the palate. very perfumed and fragrant, too, with flavors of assorted dried fruit, vanilla, golden raisin, citrus, and honey that dry quickly on the palate. a suggestion of peat lingers in the background and on the whisky’s clinging finish. 
"
"single malts of scotland (distilled at glenrothes) 1990, 49.4%",Single Malt Scotch,82,151,"light gold. from a refill bourbon cask, here we have more marzipan and some light maltiness alongside very fresh fruit and delicate vanilla. this is rothes in slightly lean and hungry mode, with its signature fruits and spices in the background. needs water to smooth things out. when that happens, there’s lemon drizzle cake, leafiness, and walnut flour. a little short on the finish.  £90"
"glenturret peated edition, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,82,73,"this expression comprises peated glenturret malt (55ppm) and some older unpeated glenturret malt. the distillery has been making peated malt for six years. there is a higher proportion of peated malt in this revised edition than in the previous version. farmyard aromas on the nose, with an overlay of digestive biscuits and subtle smokiness. light-bodied, with watery toffee and emerging peat smoke. medium-length in the finish, spicy, with cigarette smoke. £47"
"glenturret triple wood, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,82,73,"matured in a combination of first-fill spanish oak sherry butts, refill american oak hogsheads, and first-fill bourbon barrels. the nose is initially savory, with salted caramels, oak, vanilla, and toffee. medium-bodied, with brittle toffee and spicy fruit on the creamy palate, where more savory notes emerge. a hint of bourbon in the softly spiced, herbal finish, which darkens to black coffee. £47"
"the classic cask (distilled at highland park), 23 year old, 1082 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,82,70,"honey, vanilla, heather, and citrus are the major components of this highland park, with a hint of youthful peat in the background. some polished oak kicks in on the palate towards the finish. a pleasant whisky for those who like a mature highland park without the sherry cask influence. (a bayway world of liquor exclusive.) 
"
"mackillop's choice (distilled at imperial), 23 year old, 1979 vintage, 56.6%",Single Malt Scotch,82,115,"aged in a bourbon cask. this is a big, vibrantly fruity whisky (lemon, lime, orange, grape), with background notes of anise, fat barley, and vanilla. an unusual and often difficult to find dram. (bottled exclusively for “wine on the 9”.) 
"
"cask & thistle (distilled at imperial), 28 year old, 1975 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,82,100,"an interesting comparison to the mackillop’s choice expression reviewed above. this is also a big, bold whisky from the currently mothballed imperial distillery. this one is less fruity. instead it is quite sweet with a ripe maltiness up front-and rather viscous in texture-becoming dry, slightly austere, and spicy on the finish, with a wisp of smoke. (bottled exclusively for binny’s beverage depot.) 
"
"inchgower 14 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,82,59,"you could argue that there’s an element of auto-suggestion at work when you pick up saltiness in inchgower, after all, it comes from a fishing port (buckie). but taste it blind and there it is — an unmistakable salinity on nose and palate which, when combined with lemon accents, cumin seed, thin fruit syrups, and green grapes, makes this an intense, perfect, aperitif. £37 (not available in the u.s.)"
"inchmurrin 12 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,82,52,"matured in a mixture of bourbon, refill, and recharred casks. ripe peaches, malt, and vanilla on the nose, with a hint of linseed oil. oily on the palate, with more peaches, plus quite dark spices, backed by creamy vanilla. medium in length, spicy, with emerging dry oak notes. £36"
"murray mcdavid (distilled at isle of jura, 1989) 13 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,82,48,"gold color. aroma of vanilla, honeyed malt, subtle marshmallow, with background herbal, hay-like notes. light and creamy in body. creamy, malty, vanilla notes in flavor-honey sweet initially, but eventually drying out towards the finish, with soft herbal, grassy, hay notes. 
"
"laphroaig select, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,82,59,"a new, no age statement addition to the laphroaig family that blends together quarter cask, px, triple wood, and 10 year old. the nose is reminiscent of freshly-treated decking, before some classic iodine creeps in. water brings out geranium, pollen, and damp leather. the palate is simple, clean, and mild (and smoky), with bay leaf, light dried fruit, and that oily wood. undoubtedly there's a lot going on, but it’s not married, and 40% means it lacks the necessary wallop. £35"
"lombard 'jewels of scotland' (distilled at lochside), 1981 vintage, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,82,100,"lochside closed in 1992 and its whisky will become increasingly difficult to find. very fragrant and quite fruity, with lemon, raspberry, red currant, and plum on the nose. it starts out clean and fruity on the palate too, with a gentle maltiness, but this is quickly taken over by dominant toffee and caramel. a nice lochside whisky, which could have been even better with a little less toffee on the finish. 
"
"distillery select 'croftengea' (distilled at loch lomond), cask #1, 10 year old, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,82,65,"when compared to craiglodge, reviewed above, this whisky is more intensely smoky, tarry, and youthful on the palate. the other flavors, while in the same vein as craiglodge, are more reserved (or perhaps more greatly overshadowed by the peat). if your intent is full-throttle peat, this is your whisky. if you want variety on the palate, go for the craiglodge. 
"
"longrow, 10 year old, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,82,120,"this peated expression of springbank is fresh, powerful, and unbridled. a brief, gristy, sweet malt intro quickly becomes quite aggressive, with an attack of tar, damp peat, kippers, mustard seed, spanish olives, and poire williams. the sweetness emerges again briefly, before succumbing to an assertive, fiery finish. 
"
"adelphi (distilled at longmorn) 20 year old 1992, 55.1%",Single Malt Scotch,82,124,"with longmorn, you are always looking for a dense, sweet fruitiness. this doesn’t disappoint on the nose, where there’s moist compacted fruitcake with marzipan, brazil nut, glacé cherry, a hint of tobacco, then hard toffee. the palate is soft to start but then an overly firm grip and slightly bitter edges come through. though water improves it, the oak is slightly too dominant. that said, the nose is superb. £80 "
"macallan 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,82,53,"it’s young macallan. there’s a hint of sulfur (from distillate rather than cask), then wet leather, brazil nut, muesli, dried pineapple, and raisin; even a little rubber, suggestive of youth. that can’t hide the fact that this is a big, deep, oily dram. water makes it considerably more coherent, showing a substantial, thick palate with some licorice. ripe, but you can’t help feeling that 12 is a little young for this slow-maturing distillate."
"connoisseurs choice (distilled at mannochmore), 15 year old, 1990 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,82,65,"fragrant aromas of ripe barley and vanilla, with some background pear, hay, dusty cocoa, ginger, and lemon grass. similar follow through on the palate, with a creamy mouthcoating texture throughout and a drying finish. nice anytime. 
"
"signatory 'mosstowie' (distilled at miltonduff), 27 year old, 1979 vintage, cask # 12759, 54.1%",Single Malt Scotch,82,200,"a pleasing malt all around, if not overly complex or challenging. clean, full malt foundation (the lomond still is obvious), vanilla, and butterscotch with soft fruit and balancing dry oak spice that lingers on the finish. 
"
"gordon & macphail (distilled at mortlach) 15 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,82,80,"another catch-up from g&m, this time from the ‘beast of dufftown.’ immediate substance and solidity, which is what you want from mortlach, but there’s also thick-cut marmalade and cumin. only with water, however, does the classic meatiness emerge—like a lamb tangine with apricot. a cleaner, slightly lighter side to the flora & fauna 16 year old, but with heft and a burnt licorice sweetness. a great introduction to a classic distillery."
"old pulteney, 21 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,82,100,"this 21 year old expression is lighter in color and not as sweet or fruity as the younger 17 year old also reviewed here. very mouthcoating in texture, with notes of dry vanilla, fat barley, coconut, citrus fruit, and pineapple. long, intensely appetizing, dry salty finish. as an aperitif, or perhaps with seafood. 
"
"signatory (distilled at rosebank), 15 year old, 1990 vintage, cask # 1509, 56.6%",Single Malt Scotch,82,100,"the distillery closed in 1993. very fragrant, with a potpourri of dried spice, herbs, and (to a lesser degree) flowers on the nose and palate. the spices are accentuated by mint tea, fennel, clove, and faint vegetal notes. dry, spicy finish. not an elegant rosebank, but rather, this is rosebank with an attitude. 
"
"the speyside, 12 year old, 43% abv",Single Malt Scotch,82,30,"a relative newcomer to the scotch whisky industry, having just turned 12. and over the past decade, we’ve had plenty of opportunity to watch this whisky mature, as it was first bottled after a few years as drumguish, and then under the speyside name as an 8 year old and 10 year old before this 12 year old expression. this whisky continues to develop with age. the foundation of this particular bottling is a generous serving of toffee, nuts, and vanilla fudge. fruity, golden raisin and peach notes provide contrast, with toffee and subtle oak on the finish. whisky for dessert, anyone? 
"
"talisker, 20 year old, 59.7%",Single Malt Scotch,82,200,"style: highland (isle of skye) single malt scotch color: antique amber aroma: toffee, cookies fresh from the oven, waxy ripe fruit, bonfire smoke and damp peat, with background notes of pepper, brine, smoked kippers, and a hint of seaweed. palate: similar to its aroma. full-bodied and quite thick in texture. dry, smoky, peppery finish. 
"
"tomatin decades, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,82,100,"this bottling celebrates distillery manager douglas campbell’s 50 years of service at tomatin, and includes casks from 1967, 1976, 1984, and 1990, along with a peated tomatin from 2005. the nose is initially slightly musty, with faint peat smoke, sweetening to mild vanilla, with new leather and peaches in time. full-bodied, relatively dry on the palate, with the european oak casks in the ascendancy here. raisins, dark chocolate, and licorice. medium to long in the finish, drying, with spicy oak. "
"tormore, 12 year old, 40% abv",Single Malt Scotch,82,42,"soft and creamy in texture. a delicate mélange of fruit and a teasing nuttiness balance nicely with the whisky’s gently sweet notes of lightly toasted marshmallow and caramel, finishing soft and pleasingly dry. a very smooth whisky you could drink all day long. 
"
"tullibardine, 1992 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,82,50,"fresh and clean, with notes of creamy barley, cut grass, coconut marshmallow, pencil shavings, and oatcake. soft finish. subtle spice dances about in the background. bottling at 46% adds to the richness. a soothing whisky. 
"
"tullibardine 225 sauternes, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,82,70,"tullibardine 225 sauternes is finished in sauternes dessert wine casks from chateau suduiraut in bordeaux, and the nose majors in citrus fruits, vanilla, pepper, and a discreet herbal note. citrus fruits carry through to the spicy palate, with jaffa orange to the fore, plus malt. spicy to the very end, with milk chocolate and a suggestion of passion fruit."
"oban 14 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,82,65,"a much-beloved malt in the u.s. some say it’s because it is easy to pronounce (though having said that, remember it’s ‘oh-bin’ and not ‘o’bahn’). i’d prefer to think its popularity is because there is something about the fresh cleanliness of the nose, its orange oils, chocolate, and zesty-zingy and yes, occasionally salty spiciness that is instantly appealing."
"eades speyside 'double malt', 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,82,70,"an equal marriage of longmorn and glen moray whiskies. quite a fruity adventure, with zingy notes of bramble, strawberry, rhubarb, sultana, nectarine, and plum. all this fruit sits on a bed of creamy vanilla malt (the longmorn influence is quite evident) that coats the palate long after the finish."
"eades islay 'double malt', 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,82,70,"consists of 60% bowmore and 40% caol ila. bold, youthful, and somewhat medicinal (as would be expected), with peat smoke, tar, pebbles on a beach, and boat docks. additional flavors of smoked olives and exotic pepper add intrigue, while honeyed malt notes soothe the palate and provide balance.
"
"wemyss vintage malts 'the peat chimney,' 8 year old, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,82,40,"aggressive earthy smoke, tar, fiery pepper, bath soap, and ginger tamed by toffee and ripe malt. lingering smoldering peat, anise, and tobacco. for those who like smoky whiskies young, aggressive, and unabashed.
"
"wemyss vintage malts 'the spice king,' 8 year old, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,82,40,"nectarine, tangerine, toffee, and vanilla on the nose. there’s also teasing smoke, if you look for it. the sweet fruity notes start at the beginning of the palate, then cinnamon, nutmeg, cut hay, and smoke kick in. lingering cracked pepper, clove, and distant smoke. good gritty texture. dynamic stuff for a young whisky.
"
"wemyss the peat chimney 12 year old, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,82,55,"the problem with selling your whisky by description is that if you don't deliver what you've claimed in the name, you're in trouble. that's a little bit how it was with these whiskies when they were seven years old. at this age, though, these are big boy whiskies and there is plenty of peat, seaweed, oil, barbecued fish, and salty sea notes to keep you hooked. nicely balanced with fruit, too.  £35"
"lombard speyside, 8 year old, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,82,30,"quite fragrant and fairly sweet (but not cloyingly so), rich with nutty toffee, nougat, and bright summer fruits. clean, gently sweet finish. well rounded, nicely matured for its age and, at $30, a good value these days. a versatile whisky to keep in the drinks cabinet; it’s enjoyable enough sipping neat or with a splash of water, but (at this price) you won’t cringe if your guests drink it on the rocks or use it as a mixer. "
"smokehead, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,82,55,"youthful and fiery, oozing with testosterone. toffee apple intoxicated with kiln-trapped peat smoke, charcoal ash, anise, honeyed malt, brine, peppered seaweed, kippers, and damp earth. brisk and warming. okay, this is a young, “in your face” islay single malt. young islay whiskies show the true character of islay (which i like), and this is a young one. ideally, i’d like to see another five years, not chill-filtered, and bottled at 46% abv, but there’s still a sort of “raw edge” attraction here."
"singleton of dufftown reserve collection unité, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,82,58,"very singleton of dufftown: while that means easy drinking and approachable, it also
can suggest a single malt without a spark of wayward genius. this is,
typically, very ordered: nuts and honey with malt and pecan pie underneath. as
it opens there’s dried lemon, oak, dried fig, and (dilute) pencil shavings. the
palate is—typically—sweet and thick, though here with a refreshing sharpness,
like a mix of wine gums and cider. i’d add a rock or two of ice. (travel retail exclusive) £38/1 liter"
"hazelburn cv, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,82,52,"hazelburn cv is the non-age-statement version of springbank’s unpeated, triple distilled single malt, introduced in 2010 to accompany the existing 8 and 12 year old variants. initially slightly mashy and herbal on the nose, with acetone and cigarette packets. citric and more malty with time. orange, ginger, vanilla, and sherbet zest on the spicy palate. the finish is medium in length and spicy, with a slight suggestion of salt. a fresh, breezy, aperitif dram. £33 (not available in the u.s.)"
"master of malt speyside single malt 30 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,82,157,"master of malt is an online whisky retailer, branching out with its own bottlings. this, from an unnamed distillery, is lightly honeyed with some quince, apricot, and yellow plum, while there’s a mix of vanillin and dry bracken/grass behind. light, clean, and balanced, the palate is refined and relaxed with demerara-like sweetness and a finish of honey-coated nuts. i wanted more oomph on the palate, which might have come at 43% or 46%. £100"
"master of malt reference series ii, 47.5%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,82,91,"this laudable effort of comparative whiskies explores the effect of age by combining four parcels of stock in different proportions. the older whiskies produce an enticing nose of marmalade-encrusted ham on the bone, grist, and worn sandpaper. it’s sugary sweet with ripe melon before the sherry takes control and dishes out cherry candy and papaya. held in the mouth, it develops layers of creamy latte and milk chocolate as the fruit fades. more to get your teeth into here. £54"
"master of malt 10 year old, 47.5%",Blended Scotch Whisky,82,64,"batch 1 of this new blend brings oxidized apple, maple syrup, crispy potato skins, soft spices, and nutmeg grated over eggnog. rich strands of citrus, mint, and raisins mingle, building in intensity to greater spiciness at the swallow, where ginger and burnt sugar emerges. undiluted, there is a hot, spicy, slightly acrid finish dominated by the ginger. water adds melon, mandarin, and apple and manages to keep the ginger in check. £40"
"shieldaig classic, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,82,18,"in blended whisky terms, this isn’t for the faint-hearted, and joins a number of recent releases prepared to show off its
darker, grittier side. it’s a big flavored blend, with its heart in the islands, and with oily coastal notes reminiscent of a delicatessen: brine, salty cheese, some crab apple relish, and smoked fish. it’s a rugged bruiser, but it makes its mark with some style."
"monarch of the glen 8 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,82,15,"standard blends fall into two categories: those that will behave nicely when mixed to offer almost non-whisky experience, and those that are feistier and want to make sure you know they’re there. this is the former, and with whiskies like this one, it’s possible to blink and miss it. that doesn’t make it bad; just indistinctive and unexceptional. there is little sign of the wood here, but the delicate, sweet apricot notes just do enough."
"douglas laing provenance 8 year old (distilled at ben nevis), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,82,67,"this single cask (#10328) bottling was distilled in the summer of 2006 and matured in a refill hogshead. the nose is initially slightly mashy, with savory notes, becoming more floral, with caramel. bold and spicy on the palate, with roasted meat and underlying citrus fruit and herbal notes. mildly metallic dark chocolate in the medium-length finish.  £42"
"douglas laing old particular (distilled at glenallachie) 22 year old, 51.5%",Single Malt Scotch,82,130,"light gold. a little shy initially, but glenallachie isn’t noted for its effusiveness. it has a clean and slightly nutty aroma, with light honey alongside grilled hazelnut. the palate is fairly crisp and slightly bunched up to start, until this nutty sweetness expands in the center. ever so slightly oily. water flattens the aromatics a bit, but allows the flavors to spread gently. all in all, a decent example of an uncommonly seen single malt. £85"
"douglas laing provenance (distilled at fettercairn) 2003, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,82,56,"an 11 year old fettercairn from douglas laing, this is an undemanding but pleasing highland dram. it comes from a distillery which tends to polarize opinion among drinkers. the nose is light and crisp, slightly floral, with pear juice and a hint of honey. sweet and spicy on the palate, with hazelnuts and drinking chocolate. powdery in the finish, with tangerines and a suggestion of parma violets. £37"
"douglas laing old particular (distilled at macallan) 21 year old, 51.5%",Single Malt Scotch,82,101,"full gold. a solid middle-weight macallan with some putty/play-doh, and even after this length of time, a certain youthful airiness. this slightly lean aspect gives way to an almost suety richness. when neat, the palate is a little jumbled: caramelized cask-derived notes, cereal, oiled jackets. water improves things, releasing an aroma akin to chenin blanc, then cooked pear and a big hit of sugared almonds on the back palate. £69"
"douglas laing single minded speyside 15 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,82,88,"a broad and humid aroma, like walking through hot bracken in the summer. quite substantial, with lemon, pecan, and, in time, chestnut. it’s this last aroma that carries through most strongly onto the tongue. there’s light grip, and even at 46% some level of heat. water reveals oak and pencil shavings/cedar, while the grip has now loosened. out comes a more crisp attack and hints of delicate top notes. the finish is pretty dry. £56"
"the exclusive malts  (distilled at caledonian)  28 year old 1987, 52.1%",Single Malt Scotch,82,191,"overripe cantaloupe, green apple, banana custard, and whole almond are the main soloists, though they are accompanied by a linear grain overture running through it. a quartet of golden sultana, mint, ginger, and pepper play the opening movement, then sit back as toffee-dipped banana flavors orchestrate a delicious climax before a diminuendo into minor chords, with sour gooseberry and herbal notes to finish. water works well, elevating bright notes of lemon sponge on the palate. (238 bottles)"
"the exclusive malts blend of malts 20 year old 1994, 50%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,82,100,"whiskies from undisclosed speyside and highland distilleries are blended together in first-fill sherry butts. on the nose it’s an alluring blend of orange, cherry, toffee, salt, and ginger. the entry follows the nose with toffee, orange, ginger, and malt. things begin to drop off in the mid-palate, which is very focused on salt and ginger, with strong alcohol undertones. the alcohol drives and defines a dry finish that's absent of much of what's so alluring about this whisky. (u.s. only)"
"single malts of scotland (distilled at bunnahabhain) 25 year old, 50.4%",Single Malt Scotch,82,206,"gold. quite sweet and spicy nose. light cinnamon and that distillery ginger edge. there remains a light cereal aspect to the background, but it is considerably more youthful than the age suggests. the palate is equally sweet and direct, with excellent spicy concentration. water shows that there is some weight here, reminiscent of honey-nut cornflakes (with cream). the nose now hints at some oxidation, the palate retains peppery freshness. it’s another i’d have kept in cask. £135"
"grand macnish sherry cask 15 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,82,35,"naming your blend “sherry cask” retains an air of ambiguity to it. theoretically, it could be the maturation or finishing vessel for all or some of the constituents. the whisky is light-bodied and the sweet sherry is evident, though a nip of bitterness interrupts. smoother on the palate than the 12 year old, there’s strawberry, raspberry, and background spice, with a blackberry note late in the finish. overall, there’s less flavor development, but it’s an old-school kind of blend."
"strathclyde 12 year old, 62.1%",Single Grain Whisky,82,73,"an official strathclyde from chivas bros., presented in its squat bottle from their under-appreciated cask strength edition series. i found a peculiar nose comprising shafts of lemongrass, garlic bulb, root ginger, taffy candy, and green tea. as an iron dram, it’s oily and bold, with coconut, fresh mint, and green pea, with a savory note tugging at the taste buds. dilution highlights scallions, a light creamy toffee, and reese’s peanut butter cups. curiously intriguing: for bold flavor explorers only. £43"
"adelphi (distilled at glenrothes) 7 year old, 67.4%",Single Malt Scotch,82,135,"massive with a huge sherried attack; seven years is the right time to bottle. there’s light raisin, date, and fig roll/treacle toffee, but it’s a funny one as it develops; while it is superficially impressive, it becomes clear that the oak-driven and distillery-derived parts, aren’t talking to each other. water brings out light cask-driven sulfur. on the palate, the black fruits and demerara rum take initial charge along with menthol. it’s tannic already, though. lacks integration, but what else to do?"
"port dundas 12 year old, 40%",Single Grain Whisky,82,50,"it’s been four years since diageo last released an official single grain whisky from this glasgow distillery. this will kick off your evening with its aromas of golden syrup flapjacks, light vanilla sponge fingers, and waxy linseeds. the american oak notes are all over this: vanilla, sweet granola, and pecan, yet there is a squeeze of lemon and a square of milk chocolate too. the creamy finish has real length and makes this a most accessible grain whisky."
"the fat trout, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,82,25,"delicate nose of sherbet and melting heather honey layered over pleasant grassy and herbal notes. the texture is sweet, thin, and syrupy, with a slight vegetal note, before salted caramel reels it in, brimming over into a briny finish like a salty kiss. the grain clearly plays a major role. truth be told, the aromas and flavors work well, but the lack of weight makes it feel like a tiddler rather than catch of the day. (selected u.s. states, nz, switzerland)."
"label 5 classic black, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,82,17,"this is the foundation stone of the whole label 5 range and it’s a solid, reputable blend that works neat, with a rock of ice, or in cocktails. the digestive biscuits, dark walnut toffee, and fruit salad aromas concede to a rather inauspicious palate of burnt orange, malt biscuits, charred oak, and ground ginger. it’s lively through to its malt and spice conclusion."
"cadenhead’s (distilled at benriach) 1996, 46.5%",Single Malt Scotch,82,145,"once again, some assertive distillery character to the fore which, in benriach’s case, means plenty of ripe sweet fruits, cooked apples, a jag of citrus, and a background malty note. there’s a pleasant, slightly oxidative, wine-like note with water. the sweetness dominates the palate, with the nuttiness moving to hot breakfast cereal and, in typical benriach fashion, a sweet spiced finish. lovely, but not overly different from official bottlings."
"usquaebach reserve, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,82,40,"this blend is generously half malt and half grain, unusually selecting 16-18 year old malts. the result has a nose of rich honey and florals, resplendent in a citrus intensity: squeezed orange skin with a background note of dry crackers. the palate is orange and malty, with cola, faint spices, and a little waxiness, but the core feels a little hollow. a good length finish where the pleasant buzz has a slight peatiness rubbed in. a decent stand-up dram."
"old particular (distilled at cambus) 27 year old, 51.5%",Single Grain Whisky,82,126,"oh boy! it’s like tearing open a warm banana-and-toffee muffin, the steam bringing the moist, sweet goodness to your nostrils. roasted peach and neat orange cordial join the party. on the palate, the alcohol strength is noticeably strong, with flavors of red currant, cranberry, and black pepper. at the fruitier end of the cambus spectrum, this concludes with a whimper of spices, leading to a nip of cinnamon and bitter vanilla in the tail. (270 bottles) £87"
"bruichladdich octomore (edition 01.1), 5 years old, 63.5%",Single Malt Scotch,82,185,"this is the new super-peated (131 ppm phenol barley) bruichladdich. “super-peated” seems almost like an understatement. ultra-peated, perhaps? intense smoke on the nose and palate, with notes of freshly tarred road, cigar smoke and ash, licorice root, bacon fat, kalamata olive, and smoked seaweed. struggling to emerge are youthful orchard fruit, honeyed malt, brine, and soft vanilla. long, smoky finish -- like licking the walls of a peat-infused kiln. a very invigorating whisky. it’s a few years younger than the other ultra-peated whisky, ardbeg supernova. i think if they were both the same age, i would like them equally (and score them equally -- i gave supernova an 89). but the octomore does taste a little green, which was not noticeable in the supernova. i think octomore will be very good in another five years, and amazing in another ten. let’s hope the lads at bruichladdich are holding some stocks back."
"duncan taylor (distilled at invergordon), cask #15517, 41 year old, 50.2% ",Grain Scotch Whisky,81,200,"some of these older duncan taylor grain whiskies are very individualistic and exciting. with others, the wood has gotten the best of them (grain whiskies are light in body and thus vulnerable to excessive oak aging). this one, fortunately, gravitates more towards the former, with a rather reserved oak influence, given its age. a bit tight on the nose. rather sweet too, and somewhat viscous. notes of vanilla, crème brulee, marzipan, caramel-coated popcorn, brown sugar, toasted coconut, and subtle pineapple and papaya. a gentle dried spice finish rescues the whisky from all the sweetness.
"
"the arran malt, 10 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,81,45,"a fruity-sweet whisky (but still quite light and lively), with notes of orange marmalade, lemon meringue pie, and apricot. there’s also an underlying vanilla maltiness that is balanced nicely by oak spice on the finish. a respectable effort for a 10 year old and versatile enough to drink any time of the day (but i would prefer it before dinner). 
"
"auchentoshan 10 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,81,33,"light, clean, and delicate on the palate, with creamy vanilla, marshmallow, soft fruit (lemon, lime), and a touch of honey throughout. nicely balanced and uncomplicated. a whisky to appeal to both the malt and blend drinker. 
"
"scott's selection (distilled at auchentoshan), 21 year old, 1983 vintage, 52.4%",Single Malt Scotch,81,145,"surprisingly thick and oily in texture for a lowlander. there’s plenty of marshmallow, vanilla cream, and ripe barley, with interspersed cut grass, lemon, and mustard seed. drying oak spice notes on the finish. not as polished or refined as the distillery bottling of the same age, but it still has many redeeming qualities. 
"
"benromach traditional, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,81,35,"gordon & macphail purchased the benromach distillery from united distillers and reopened the distillery in 1998. they installed new stills and are using malt with a recognizable level of peating. this is first official bottling from the whisky that they themselves have made. the whisky is still youthful, but for a whisky of such youth it shows great balance, individuality, and promise. notes of vanilla cream, honey, and fruit (pineapple, pear) are peppered with nuances of smoke, herbs, and pine. youthful, vibrant finish. i eagerly look forward to tasting this whisky with a half dozen more years of aging. 
"
"benromach, 18year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,81,80,"nicely balanced, and easy to drink. pit fruits (peaches, apricots) and lemon are the dominant notes, with underlying vanilla cream, butterscotch, and a hint of honey. gently dry, delicately spicy finish. the most rounded of the four. 
"
"peerless (distilled at bowmore) 1966, 36 year old, 45.3%",Single Malt Scotch,81,160,"full gold color. layers of citrus fruit on the nose (especially seville orange, lemon, grapefruit), with just a faint hint of peat smoke and floral, herbal notes. light to medium in body. it tastes similar in many ways to its aroma-there’s plenty of citrus fruit. the fruit comes first, followed by the classic ""older bowmore"" oaky dryness. an echo of flavors repeats this sequence-first the citrus fruit, then the dry oak flavors. some peat smoke teases in the background, but is mostly restrained. fry, oaky, faintly peaty finish.
   style: islay single malt scotch whisky. price: approx. $160. available at select retailers. 
   this whisky is classic older bowmore (30+ years), with its exotic citrus fruit, distinctive oaky dryness, and faintest hint of peat smoke. "
"douglas laing old particular (distilled at bowmore) 15 year old, 48.4%",Single Malt Scotch,81,153,"bowmore in unusually oily guise here, with linseed oil, hot seashells, background water mint, completely integrated smoke, and a cooling note that brings to mind a lido (without any chlorine, i hasten to add). the palate has a limey lift which flows into a quite thick, creamy/oaty mid-palate, with the smoke bedding itself on the tongue. smoky and mineralic on the finish. water makes it even more gentle. a light expression for the early morning. £98"
"bruichladdich, 18 year old, 1986 vintage, 57.5%",Single Malt Scotch,81,140,"its color suggests sherry cask influence, and its aroma confirms. the initial impact on the palate is lush fruit, followed by a clean honeyed malt foundation. toffee and nuts emerge, with that satisfying bruichladdich freshness and brine kicking in on the finish, providing some balance for the somewhat waxy, sherried sweetness. (a park avenue liquors exclusive.) 
"
"bruichladdich laddie eight 8 year old, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,81,65,"another travel retail exclusive, and while you might expect something delicate given the age statement, what is delivered is a thick, buttery/creamy opening that, for a second, teeters on the brink of sourness then pulls back to be more like ricotta cheese. it then settles into vanilla, floral notes, white chocolate, and sweet barley. the palate is thick once again, with lemon cheesecake giving a needed clean acidity. quite a bulky youngster that’s best with water. (travel retail exclusive) £45"
"caol ila, 18 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,81,65,"this caol ila was released the same time as the 12 year old, reviewed above. older isn't always better, especially with islay whiskies. i felt that way when comparing ardbeg 17 to ardbeg 10 year old, and i feel the same with these two caol ila whiskies. this 18 year old has the same flavor profile as the 12 year old. it's a well-rounded dram too, but it has lost the vibrancy and dynamic intensity of the 12 year old. if you want to experience caol ila in its entire youthful splendor-and save a few bucks while you're at it-then buy the 12 year old."
"mackillop's choice (distilled at caol ila), 26 year old, 1979 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,81,135,"mature and gentle, when compared to the 1990 expression above. if the flavors of the 1990 caol ila reviewed above are nakedly exposed, then this caol ila is wearing a winter coat. the same flavor notes are there, but they’re less noticeable. pleasingly salty, gently drying finish. 
"
"caol ila unpeated 12 year old special release 2011, 64%",Single Malt Scotch,81,84,"an established regular member of diageo’s annual set of special releases, this expression celebrates the lesser-known side of islay’s largest distillery; its production of a non-smoked expression. it was this unpeated style that saved caol ila during the great decimation of distilleries in the early 1980s. this example is intense and needs lots of water for its fragrance of cut grass, sherbet, and coconut water to emerge. the palate shows boiled sweets and has a pleasingly clinging quality. £53 "
"wemyss malts (distilled at caol ila) 16 year old 1996, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,81,109,"initially what we have are classic caol ila notes: cod liver oil, soft pear-like fruits, and a glimpse of lobster cooked in sea water. it’s not so much smoky as ozonic and, though it seems a little exposed with water, there’s a squeeze of lemon (for the lobster, maybe). on the tongue there’s a light ashy note before the mouth is slowly filled. any smoke is in check and understated. this is about citric freshness and salt. £70"
"murray mcdavid mission iv (distilled at clynelish), 1976 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,81,210,"thick in texture and palate-coating. ripe peaches and bananas, orange chocolate, english toffee, and a hint of damp oak on the nose. i can also detect brine, seaweed, peat smoke, and spice, but it’s a little clumsy. same story on the palate. not a bad whisky, but i expect more from clynelish. 
"
berry brothers & rudd (distilled at cragganmore) 1997 14 year old,Single Malt Scotch,81,93,"light straw. initially this is quite hot and a little dumb, with whiffs of indian spice — think turmeric and curry leaf — along with mint sauce (but no lamb) and a tickle of peat. the palate is quite intense and hot, with powdered almond, a grassy edge, and concentrated sweetness that starts in the center and builds toward the back palate. subtle, but can’t help wishing there was just a little more say from the cask. £59"
"deanston organic 15 year old, 46.3%",Single Malt Scotch,81,115,"deanston distillery has released its first organic single malt, aged for 15 years in new oak barrels. it is non-chill filtered.  stem ginger, white pepper, cloves, and vanilla on the nose. the palate is rich with intensely sweet early fruit notes, honey, more ginger, and now black pepper. becoming nuttier and slightly metallic in the finish with spicy oak and a hint of aniseed. (germany and travel retail) £80"
"blackadder raw cask #6437 (distilled at glen grant) 1971 vintage, 31 year old, 55.7% abv",Single Malt Scotch,81,175,"from a sherry hogshead, which is confirmed by its deep amber/crimson color. a very clean whisky for 31 years in oak, and its complexity is subtle. it’s sort of the antithesis of the blackadder longmorn also reviewed here. both are heavily sherried. the longmorn shows its age proudly, and is bold, complex, and a bit rustic. this one is clean, more conservative, and nicely balanced. you’ll find notes of honey-laced fruit, caramel, and toffee, with an infusion of nutty, ginger-spiced notes, leading to a polished oak finish. a straight-forward and uncomplicated speysider. 
"
"glen grant, 10 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,81,45,"light (for a speysider), floral, fresh, and elegant, showing honeyed vanilla and lively fruit, along with a hint of marshmallow and hay. soft, dry finish. pleasant, straightforward, and uncomplicated. a good clean introductory malt that’s easy to embrace. 
"
"glencadam, 15 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,81,60,"the first official distillery release to the u.s. since the distillery was purchased by angus dundee. this is a thick, mouth-coating whisky. notes of ripe malt, toffee, sweet berries, and caramel apples. it dries out quite nicely towards the finish, with spicy oak notes to keep it from becoming too cloying. 
"
"glenfarclas family cask 1962 (cask 2639), 48.9%",Single Malt Scotch,81,899,"more of a reddish hue, but as equally robust as the 1961 (see below). some baked characters alongside dried cherry and barberry, which shift toward balsamic-like concentration. hint of black pudding (blood sausage) and bitter chocolate. the palate is tight and tannic, with a hint of smoke and cooked dried fruits. water loosens the tannic grip, allowing licorice to show. (a u.s. exclusive.)"
"glenfiddich 125th anniversary, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,81,109,"bottled for this auspicious occasion, this is a glenfiddich that confounds people’s expectations by being smoky, not from casks (à la caoran) but the distillate. fresh, with a nose that brings to mind eating apples and hazelnuts around a late summer bonfire; the smoke seems in charge. on the palate, the reverse happens, with the fruits being thrust forward and the smoke only emerging on the finish. it’s vibrant and needs water, and is a lot of fun. happy birthday! (travel retail and distillery shop exclusive)£70  "
"glenkinchie 12 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,81,60,"like dalwhinnie, glenkinchie starts life as a (deliberately) sulfury new make, but this character falls away in time to reveal delicacy. as a 10 year old, that sulfur could still be hanging around — one reason for the switch to a 12 year age statement. the improvement is noticeable. here are gently lifted floral notes, hints of dry grass, and crisp pear. the feel is gentle and slow in the center, while vanilla creeps into the finish. not complex, but very pleasant."
"the glenlivet guardians single cask 18 year old, 55.7%",Single Malt Scotch,81,238,"a limited edition—there are only 630 bottles of this—for those who are “glenlivet guardians.” a sherry refill, it’s a gentle expression that has typical glenlivet floral elements that are more lifted than usual: elderflower cordial, jasmine, and night-scented stocks. a subtle spiciness emerges with a drop of water. this general smoothness continues on the palate with ginger in syrup and an enlivening citric note on the finish. "
"hart brothers (distilled at glenturret), 10 year old, 1991 vintage, 53.6% abv",Single Malt Scotch,81,63,"very fragrant and floral, with bright notes of citrus (lemons, orange) and fresh grass. similar on the palate, with additional notes of soft honeyed malt and vanilla. clean, fresh, appetizing finish. a nice aperitif or, better yet, a liquid sorbet between courses. 
"
"the macphail's collection (distilled at glenturret), 15 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,81,55,"gently sweet, with toffee, nougat, and honey-glazed nuts, balanced by bright citrus and sultana. a soothing, unpretentious, malt i would save for after dinner. 
"
"highland park, cask #2310, 1991 vintage, 14 year old, 56.7%",Single Malt Scotch,81,80,"generally sweet notes of honeyed fruit, orange marmalade, dark chocolate, and salt water taffy. soft, gently briny finish. pleasing enough of a whisky -- with no miscues -- but missing the depth found in some of the older bottlings. (bottled for texas)"
"gordon & macphail (distilled at highland park), 12 year old, 1992 vintage, 58.1%",Single Malt Scotch,81,70,"medium-bodied but viscous in texture. clearly aged in a bourbon cask-there's plenty of honeyed malt and vanilla throughout. hints of bourbon even peek through occasionally, along with some subtle peat. soft melon mid-palate yields to dried spice, sea salt, bitter chocolate and herbal notes on the finish. fairly dry for a 12 year old-particularly on the finish. best served as an aperitif."
"inchmurrin 21 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,81,138,"this is the oldest expression of inchmurrin to be released by loch lomond, who make it in their highly versatile distillery at
alexandria. brittle toffee and cod liver oil on the nose, with vanilla and a whiff of jaffa oranges. smooth and full on the palate, more substantial and sophisticated than the younger inchmurrin variants. the fruits are now more citric. lengthy and unctuous in the finish, with more citrus fruit, gentle spice, and a touch of oak. £90"
"inchmurrin madeira finish, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,81,80,"a soft, perfumed nose, with orchard fruits, vanilla, and a lightly spiced background. voluptuous and initially very sweet on the palate, with malt and almonds, then ginger and chili kick in. lively spices and fruit-and-nut chocolate continue through the lengthy and ultimately dry finish. £55"
"inchmurrin 12 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,81,75,"soft and warm on the nose, with peaches in syrup, heather, hazelnut, and mild ginger. quite full and richly fruity on the palate: apricots and more peaches, plus stronger ginger and a hint of spicy oak. lingering in the sweet finish, with gentle spices."
"jura elixir, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,81,25,"jura elixir is exclusive to the sainsbury’s supermarket chain, and takes its name from the legend that the water of jura possesses life-prolonging qualities. elixir was finished in a mix of american white oak and ex-sherry casks.  the nose is mildly fungal, with caramel and sea salt. treacle toffee, ginger, and citrus fruits on the palate, which is ultimately slightly acrid. the finish is medium in length and spicy, with licorice. £16 (350 ml)"
"lagavulin cask #1716 (distilled 1998) feis ile 2012 bottling, 55.1%",Single Malt Scotch,81,133,"at first i wondered what was going on here. this lagavulin has more of the austerity typical of port ellen. there’s a tense minerality on the nose giving the impression of salty rock-pools and samphire. water makes it sweeter and oyster-like. there’s big delivery on the tongue, with masses of distillery character, but that tension remains to the saline finish. in a head-to-head with caol ila, the former wins hands down. £85	"
"murray mcdavid (distilled at littlemill), 1991 vintage, 16 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,81,90,"rather soft whisky, with gently sweet notes of vanilla, marshmallow, and macaroon, with underlying tropical fruit, cut grass, and subtle spearmint. a feminine whisky to have with dessert -- or as dessert."
"longrow, gaja borolo finish, 7 year old, 55.8%",Single Malt Scotch,81,125,"grape candy, raisin, blueberries, vanilla malt, and lavender, with hints of lemon and spearmint. more aggressive campfire embers and damp earth burn underneath, along with some salt. a whisky that grows on you, and not bad for 7 years old.
"
"scott's selection (distilled at longmorn), 33 year old, 1971 vintage, 53.5%",Single Malt Scotch,81,170,"succulent, sappy, with plenty of oak. this whisky is quite fruity, with tangerine, lemon, and strawberries. it is balanced by fat barley, almonds and damp oak. it is not as polished and rounded as the gordon & macphail longmorn reviewed above. indeed, the fruity, damp oak notes can be quite dominant in this whisky. however, the whisky evolves constantly on the palate and there are some minty, spicy underlying notes which add intrigue. definitely save this one for after dinner. 
"
"scott's selection (distilled at old pulteney), 1977 vintage, 56.9%",Single Malt Scotch,81,135,"appetizingly briny and spicy, as would be expected from a pulteney-especially on the nose. the spice notes (cinnamon, licorice root, vanilla) are balanced with light caramel and toffee. quite dry, polished leather finish with suggestions of bourbon. while still enjoyable, i feel this would have been a better whisky if it were bottled 5-10 years ago. 
"
"signatory 'craigduff' (distilled at strathisla), 33 year old, 1973 vintage, 47.5%",Single Malt Scotch,81,300,"strathisla whisky produced from peaty water, to create a different variant of strathisla. the two dominant characteristics here are ripe fruit (berries, raisin, pineapple, citrus) and wood spices (cinnamon, clove, mint). the sherry cask and 33 years on oak have left their impact. the fruit and honeyed/toffee almond sweetness is to the fore with the dry spices kicking in later. they balance themselves out, but i wonder what this whisky tasted like fifteen years ago before the sherry and oak took the upper hand? 
"
"wemyss malts (distilled at aultmore) 20 year old 1982, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,81,155,"aultmore is part of the dewar’s stable and another of speyside’s forgotten light brigade. here is a noseful of esters: bubblegum, pineapple, pink grapefruit, strawberries, and icing sugar. visions of “legally blonde” flash through the mind. the palate is equally energetic, though with little cask influence it’s a bit gawky and slightly green, especially with water, suggesting that another year wouldn’t have done it any harm. still, all very lovely.  £100"
"port askaig 12 year old, 45.8%",Single Malt Scotch,81,67,"a trio of new expressions of what has become an established islay brand. this one has a vibrant, edgy opening, almost like a burning lawnmower box, mixed with needed oiliness (gun oil), white tea, and, in time, the rather pleasant note of a cold fish supper. the palate is broad, and though light, the oils allow it to cling to the tongue as the salt, lime, and smoke all begin to build. a little hard, but pleasantly bracing.£44 "
"kilchoman 2006 vintage 5 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,81,75,"it often takes time for a new distillery to find its feet, but kilchoman’s spirit was top quality from the first day. its limited-edition releases act as markers on a work in progress, but are precociously advanced for their tender years. this, the first 5 year old, leads with a note like wet rushes/wet dog (that’s good!) alongside lightly turfy smoke. the palate is sweet, smoked, and thick with allspice on the finish. a star is born."
"royal lochnagar 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,81,52,"diageo’s smallest distillery and another that has worm tubs. the character here is grassy: think hay and straw rather than lawn clippings. there’s just a hint of cereal behind, and a fresh, roasted spiciness. the palate has good central sweetness where you just get a hint of fruit. light and fresh, and a good afternoon dram. £33"
"glen moray 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,81,40,"a malt that was overlooked by one owner (glenmorangie) and is now, under the auspices of a new one (la martiniquaise), beginning to ease itself back into the single malt world. its problem has been the price: too low (see speyburn). the standard 12 year old bottling gives a perfect idea of its potential. this is as soft and sweet a malt as you could ask for: peaches, toffee, and baked apple, with a tobacco/cedar/pine note from the oak. "
"berry bros. & rudd (distilled at glen moray) 21 year old 1991, 57.3%",Single Malt Scotch,81,112,"thanks to the suicidal pricing policy of its previous owner, glen moray has been considered nothing more than a bargain basement malt, but at its best it is a very sweet, lightly malty dram. this is as soft as a lemon cream bun in a sunlit baker’s shop. water brings out banana chews while the tongue brings to mind a picnic with baked scones and apricot jam. the only negative is slightly needling alcohol, so dilute and drink quickly. £72"
"fettercairn fasque, 42%",Single Malt Scotch,81,53,"while its regular stablemate fior contains a proportion of peated malt, fasque is unpeated, and the best comparison is with the now-discontinued 12 year old ‘1824’ house bottling. the nose is fragrant, with sherry, cherries, and vanilla. relatively full-bodied, with a rich, spicy palate, focusing on jaffa oranges and dark chocolate. it dries quite quickly to black coffee and spicy licorice, which linger in the mouth, along with a note of toffee. £35"
"singleton of dufftown reserve collection trinité, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,81,78,"full-bodied and sweet on the nose, mixing burlap, bran, fruit cake, hazelnut purée, malt
extract; with water it becomes fresher and almond-like with a touch of
greengage plum. the palate has a soft feel, with the thickness displayed in the
nose alongside plums and crystallized ginger. it’s just a little flabby. i’d
like a bit more freshness or grip. the finish is nutty and rich. (travel retail exclusive) £51/1 liter "
"singleton of glen ord 15 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,81,82,"released in taiwan in 2010, 15 year old singleton of glen ord offers deep, smooth sherry and ginger notes on the nose. there’s vanilla, cocktail cherries, orange, malt, and dark chocolate on the palate. long in the fruity then drying finish, cocoa powder, and finally, rather bitter oak. rm329"
"singleton of glen ord 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,81,61,"launched in southeast asia in 2006, 12 year old glen ord boasts a nose that is sweet and gingery, with toffee, a hint of tangerine, along with vanilla, sherry, and oriental spices. the palate mirrors the nose with more spice, then chocolate, and milky coffee. finally, quite drying. rm247"
"the singleton of glendullan classic, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,81,60,"glendullan has an unfortunate moniker. any whisky with ‘dull’ in the middle of its name will always struggle in english-speaking markets. it’s a shame, because it’s always delivered a gentle, sweet, lightly fruity/estery style, making it an ideal lunchtime dram. this ticks all those boxes. green apples are there, as is cinnamon, alongside a racy acidity before water brings out more scented aromas. the finish is short, but it does its job as an easy-drinking, everyday malt. (travel retail exclusive)"
"abhainn dearg single malt special edition, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,81,239,"the first spirit distilled at abhainn dearg is now 3 years old and legally scotch single malt whisky. the distillery has celebrated with a single cask, non-colored, non-chill filtered release of 2,011 500 ml bottles. apricots, crystallized ginger, candied peel, and papier-mâché on the nose. the palate features fresh fruit, spicy oak, honeycomb, and finally, toffee. quite short in the finish, with more toffee, and a nutty note. £150"
"ballantine’s 17 year old signature distillery editions – miltonduff, 43%",Blended Scotch Whisky,81,80,"a light, oily nose, a little nutty, baked apple, cinnamon, nutmeg, and malt biscuits. there are seductive dark spices and cooked fruit, almost savory, like lifting the lid on a tagine. a thinner mouthfeel showing some lime zest before a warm, enveloping glow of malt sweetness, gentle spice, toffee, raisin, and char emerges. savory, peppery finish. like nightfall, it gets darker the longer you contemplate it. with water, sweeter with more candied citrus as honeys materialize."
"ballantine’s finest, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,81,21,"a pleasant nose of light caramel, dried orange rind, butterscotch, sweet grain, and a lick of bonfire smoke, yet it’s like the volume has been dialed down to three. delicate, to the point of shyness. sweet barley, concentrated orange, a low rumble of spice, and the grain sings through. accessible, well structured, and light-textured, leading to a finish of brown sugar around the gums, although it has a stronger grain character than many in its price range."
"clan denny (distilled at girvan) 20 year old, 56.7%",Grain Scotch Whisky,81,134,"scooped-out spaghetti squash, whole red bird’s eye chilies, celery tops, and country ham. it is redolent of sugary-sweet candies like spangles (from the 1970s). light and delicate initially, moving into phases of vanilla sponge, dried raspberry, and peppery spices, then the vegetal notes grow larger in the later phases. an enjoyable effort from refill cask #10439, but it fizzles out, leaving a finish of light pepperiness, heat, and sodden newspapers. £88"
"the annasach reserve 25 year old, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,81,340,"william grant & sons rare cask reserves are micro-blends created jointly by brian kinsman and various liquor store proprietors, drawing on a choice of over 40 different single malts (importantly, not glenfiddich or balvenie). quite herbal, with tarragon, cilantro, boiled candies, and unripe plums. a slow starter; vegetal notes yield to fudge, milk chocolate, orange, and maltiness, with pepper, oak, and spices in the latter phases. stocked in only five u.s. retailers."
"sir edward’s blended whisky, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,81,14,"from the perfumed nose to the sweet and short finish, this blend doesn’t really put a foot wrong, but it’s shy and unadventurous.
clearly well made, well balanced, and quite acceptable, it has a perfumed black currant sherbet nose, some slight but enjoyable blueberry, grape, and prune notes and a soft sweet conclusion. on its own, all fine: but it gets lost when in company."
"monarch of the glen, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,81,12,"aromas of liquid honey, light toffee, dried apple, and satsuma peel. there is an initial citric attack, but when the flare dies down, a residual bitterness cuts through the underlying creaminess and caramel. sure, its component whiskies lack substance and grip, but there is some flavor progression through to an enjoyable piquancy around the gums. the finish is a nippy buzz of peel and heather honey. simple, uncomplicated, but for the price there’s plenty to like here."
"douglas laing old particular (distilled at glenburgie) 7 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,81,53,"pale straw. an upfront and quite aromatic nose with hints of a florist’s shop—stems and blooms—with an underpinning of malt. a little gawky perhaps, which water accentuates. the palate, when neat, is clean and mixes those flowers and some stewed apple. there’s a little green chili heat (even when diluted). a punchy little number. £36"
"douglas laing scallywag, 46%",Blended Scotch Whisky,81,75,"douglas laing follows up its award winning, islay-soaked big peat with this, a sherried speyside whisky. just as big peat looks like captain haddock from tintin, scallywag on the label is a dead ringer for snowy, though the official story is different. anyway, this whisky isn't a patch on the islay monster. rootsy green salad malt is only partially rescued by the trademark christmas cake and stewed fruits. likeable, but not a classic. £45"
"the exclusive malts (distilled at bowmore) 15 year old 1999 (cask #350), 54.2%",Single Malt Scotch,81,155,"nosing this whisky, you'd never guess just how fruity it is, with barnyard hay, dry malt, honey, and light smoke. on the palate, however, the fruit is unmistakable with giant mango and apple. the mid-palate takes a sharp left turn into smoke and salt, but the mango just won't let go. a very dry, smoky finish is too dry, making the case against release at this abv. an oddball whisky that will probably only appeal to a very narrow audience. (u.s. only)"
"single malts of scotland (distilled at benriach) 24 year old, 50.2%",Single Malt Scotch,81,146,"very fresh and quite light in color, suggestive of only light cask conversation. benriach’s fruits are there with hints of apricot, even some gooseberry. very light malty background, and then a whiff of witch hazel. in time, it sweetens into banana and pineapple. the palate is clean, though pretty hot, with that mature benriach fizzy spiciness on the back palate. can’t help but feel that this would have been a great 30 year old. £95"
"single malts of scotland (distilled at allt-a-bhainne) 1992, 50.2%",Single Malt Scotch,81,108,"not often seen as a single bottling, here we have speyside’s modernist distillery in typically delicate guise, with plenty of subtle florals (think hyacinth and daffodils), something which is amplified with water. imagine a cool day in early spring and you are pretty much there. the mouth is clean and fresh, with a little acidity. water doesn’t damage the palate delivery, but neither does it particularly enhance things. a sorbet rather than a meal. £65"
"highland queen 8 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,81,56,"at 8 years old, there are stiff caramels, malt, oatcakes, genoise sponge, and zested clementines on the nose. it doesn’t stint on flavor when it comes to the taste, bringing dried fig rolls, chewy toffee, aunt sally pralines, walnuts, and chocolate ganache to the party. it’s driven by dry fruit rather than sweetness, and there is a bitter edge to the swallow that persists into the finish. £35"
"darkness! (distilled at invergordon) 23 year old, 50.8%",Grain Scotch Whisky,81,117,"cometh the night. shadows veil a whisky hewn from the cold lands in the north. a whisky of black cherry, crème de prune, rancio, balsamic, and salt, for it has known a mythical chimera cask; half pedro ximénez, half oloroso wood. the magical, syrupy texture foretells of passion fruit, fig, cherry, and raisins, but prophesizes that cask char will dominate the swallow. dark forces swamp the quest for grain, though there is taste, hope, and nourishment for the journey ahead. £77"
"duncan taylor, octave (distilled at aultmore) 2008, 52.7%",Single Malt Scotch,81,82,"the recent official release of aultmore means that malt lovers are finally aware of the distillery’s intense grassy/perfumed character, and it is these characters which are prominent here, alongside a very light sherried note in the background. there appears to be real complexity on the nose for such a young example, but water shows this to be the influence of the octave cask, which unravels slightly when water is added. have it neat, and enjoy it a lot. £54"
"deveron 18 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,81,98,"formerly marketed as glen deveron and now rechristened the deveron as part of owner john dewar & sons’ last great malts initiative, this 18 year old is the oldest of three releases on offer.  oily on the nose, with apricots, sultanas, and toffee. dark spices merge with sweet apples, walnuts, and a hint of chewing tobacco on the palate. ginger and pepper in the lengthy finish."
"douglas laing old particular (distilled at north british) 21 year old, 50.9%",Single Grain Whisky,81,109,"did you hear that this distillery produced its 2.5 billionth liter of alcohol in 2015? this example from a refill hoggie has a floral bouquet, with a nose of snapped fingers of vanilla shortbread, butter frosting, and angel delight. an oily texture with flavors reminiscent of popcorn, turns to caramel, vanilla, parkin, and gingersnaps. there are some growling base notes of peppercorn, but it ends on a singed popcorn note. sticky nougat and toasted corn chips on the finish. (294 bottles) £76"
"mcdougall's selection, 13 year old, 54.7%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,80,120,"a blend of four different islay malt whiskies. a pungent, merciless islay whisky with intense peat reek, tarry rope, and raw seaweed. fiery cinnamon, clove, evergreen, and unsweetened black licorice stick just adds fuel to the fire. an underbelly of vanilla malt and suggestions of coconut cream try to douse the fire, but it's a losing battle. long, seemingly endless burning ember finish."
"ardbeg galileo, 49%",Single Malt Scotch,80,95,"released to celebrate the ardbeg space mission, this is a mix of 1990 ardbeg from bourbon and marsala casks, and it’s the latter which make the running from the start. earthy, with blackberry and fruitcake, and sooty peatiness in the background. while there’s a medicinal/herbal note with water, the palate has a damp wood edge. fortified wine can work with peat, but here there’s a clash between distillery character and the marsala cask. sadly, a disappointment."
"ardmore traditional cask, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,80,50,"a distillery bottling of ardmore finally comes to the u.s. this one is non-chill filtered and finished in a “quarter cask,” similar to laphroaig quarter cask (same owners). ardmore remains one of the few speyside whiskies made with peat-smoked malt. chewy, almost oily-textured, with sweet notes of toffee and caramel up front, followed by emerging damp, earthy peat and bourbon-like notes. the oaky, resinous bourbon lingers through the finish. the bourbon oak intensity dominates to a degree, disrupting the harmony of the remaining flavors. a whisky of great potential, but still waiting to achieve some of it."
"the arran malt, limited edition, 58.4%",Single Malt Scotch,80,70,"reddish amber color. aromas of honey drenched fruit, toffee, and fudge. medium to heavy in body. rich and sweet in flavor (toffee, fudge, caramel), with interwoven notes of rich, ripe fruit. lingering toffee sweetness on the finish. 
"
"arran single island malt, non-chill-filtered, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,80,40,"style: highland (isle of arran) single malt scotch color: straw gold aroma: youthful. pears in syrup, honeysuckle, and vanilla with a hint of caramel and citrus. palate: vibrant, somewhat youthful flavors that echo its aroma, finishing slightly sweet and a little fiery (because of its age).
   general comments: the lack of chill-filtering certainly makes this whisky more flavorful and dynamic than its filtered brethren. it also tastes a little more mature. this shows how a whisky can be affected by chill-filtering. i expect this whisky to continue improving with additional aging. price: low $40s. available nationwide."
"auchentoshan three wood, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,80,70,"an extremely atypical auchentoshan. this whisky was aged in bourbon, oloroso sherry, and pedro ximinez sherry casks. the px cask, in particular, transforms what is normally a soft, delicate whisky into a big, rich, and chewy whisky. toffee, raisins, fudge, plum, and plenty of nutty notes are interwoven throughout. an interesting adventure, but it’s hard to find the auchentoshan in there."
"auchentoshan classic, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,80,30,"light and clean, with citrus, tropical fruit (coconut, pineapple, ripe banana), white chocolate, and honeyed vanilla, resting on a clean malty foundation. soft on the finish. an easy-going whisky."
"the balvenie rum cask, 17 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,80,130,"rich and sweet, with toffee, coconut cream, turkish delight, nougat, and honey. ripe black raspberries, citrus, and dried spice (vanilla, fennel, and evergreen mint) provide complexity and attempt to balance all the sweetness. a pleasant dram, but i wish there was a little more to prop up all that sweetness. a whisky for those with a sweet tooth. good with dessert, as dessert, or with a cigar. 
"
"balvenie dcs compendium 1st chapter 2005 9 year old (cask 6587), 57.5%",Single Malt Scotch,80,576,"drawn from a refill barrel, this is balvenie all eager and bright at the start of its journey. it’s like an excited kid eating pancakes and runny honey (with a squeeze of lemon juice) at breakfast on her first day of school. there’s a hint of malt, a little peachiness, and a hint of the richness that will develop resonance in time. it’s lovely—i’d be happy to drink a couple—but way overpriced. the score has to reflect that. £400"
"benriach 40 year old, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,80,1800,"perhaps the oldest benriach on the market. i have great respect for whisky that has somehow managed to survive this many years without being bottled. if you want to taste a piece of history (which i can understand) and have unlimited funds, then go ahead and buy this. but, for the money, i prefer the benriach 25 year old (or even the 30 year old) to this whisky. deeply layered oak -- from dried, spicy oak to juicy, damp oak. notes of perfumed vanilla, roasted chestnut, and orange marmalade accentuate the oak. pretty good for 40, but its best years are behind it."
"the benriach 12 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,80,63,"clean, fresh and uncomplicated. honeyed malt, peaches and cream, with subtle floral and lime notes. dry, herbal, oaky finish with a hint of bitter chocolate. a warm-weather whisky, or as an aperitif. 
"
"benriach horizons 12 year old, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,80,82,"not satisfied with trying different levels of peating and cask types, the folks at benriach are also utilizing triple distillation. this expression has spent three years in oloroso sherry butts, although for me there’s more a mix of honey and cream, and light orchard fruits than any overt fruitcake. the palate is clean and fresh and lifted. good energy. £50 "
"benriach solstice 17 year old 2nd batch, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,80,93,"or ‘fumabat porticus’ as it should be called—smoky whisky in a port cask—not that you need to be told that when you see the color. the port takes the upper hand on the nose, giving a layer of black raspberry, sloe, and cranberry sauce. the smoke hangs in the background. this juicy fruitiness carries through to the tongue where the smoke now adds much-required dry balance. the higher alcohol also stops it becoming too jammy. £59"
"wemyss malts rhubarb royale (distilled at benrinnes) 2001, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,80,102,"here is benrinnes in very summery guise, with its signature meatiness barely discernible. instead you get lots of thyme, rosemary, and dried citrus peel. the palate is clean and concentrated, with a tart drive akin to red currant. it is this jangly effect which shows the need for dilution. water does improve things, and while the sour fruits are still there, the effect is more calm. it does lack length though. £65"
"bowmore tempest batch 3 (10 year old), 55.6%",Single Malt Scotch,80,80,"as cask strength examples of young bowmore — sold at a very keen price — the small-batch tempest range is already picking up a cult following. this third release does not disappoint in the smoke department, while the nose also shows some orange zest aromas. that said, it is a little restrained, showing its youth with a pea pod-like character on the palate, while its fruits are emerging but aren’t fully ripened. more of a strong breeze than a tempest. £50"
"elements of islay bw1 (distilled at bowmore), 52.9%",Single Malt Scotch,80,85,"though the color suggests good cask activity, the initial approach shows a dram that seems slightly unfocused and youthful. there are some kernel-like cereal elements and very little smokiness, with touches of salt and oil. the feeling is that it’s only starting to blossom — and there is a floral element — and has been bottled too early. it’s all very focused, lifted, and aromatic, but when compared to the adelphi you can’t help but wonder whether the same distillery is involved.   £55 (500 ml)"
"bunnahabhain ‘over 12 year old’ feis ile 2012 bottling, 54.3%",Single Malt Scotch,80,94,"light gold in color, the roasted almond notes that start the nose show the influence of the amontillado sherry finish before your nose is filled with the contents of a spice merchant’s chest alongside, unusually, a light maritime note. very gentle and clean in the mouth with sour plum and a generally amenable nature. more like this please, burn stewart! £60"
"bunnahabhain moine dram an stiùireadair 10 year old feis ile 2014 bottling, 56.6%",Single Malt Scotch,80,160,"stiùireadair means “helmsman” in gaelic. this has been finished for a year in marsala casks. the nose is all garden compost, moist vegetation, light smoke, and highly oxidized: like a young vin santo (or indeed marsala). very nutty, with an almost vermouth-like quality. the palate is all clove, anise, cherry stone. those oxidized wine notes are so dominant it’s shifted the balance toward the finish. this particular helmsman’s somewhat off course. £95"
"bunnahabhain moine px 12 year old, 52.7%",Single Malt Scotch,80,123,"bunnahabhain’s peaty expression is steadily coming together. it’s been one of those drams that seems to need more time than many, but that’s true of bunna’ in general, come to think of it. in fact, the peatiness is quite mild on the nose, adding some scent to the sandalwood elements and obvious raisined sweetness. there’s a slightly cheesy note in the background and a touch of sulphur on the palate. it’s not quite wholly integrated, but progressing well. (fèis ìle 2016, 833 bottles) £95"
"caol ila moch, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,80,57,"originally a one-off bottling for friends of the classic malts, ‘moch’ (gaelic for dawn, though the association between daybreak and the dram is beyond me — one for the morning ‘skailk’ maybe?) appears to have taken the place of the cask strength expression. it shows a saline, seashell-like freshness, light smoke. and a pleasant mix of salami and grassiness. the palate is clean and intense with a continuation of that oyster liquor character. great in a smoky highball. £36"
"caol ila distillers edition 1998, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,80,81,"the finish in question here is muscatel casks and you can tell that from the start, as the nose is filled with a rich, sweet, and very pronounced dusky fruitiness — sloes and plums. the smoke as a result is diminished as are the grassy/bacony notes. while the smoke does emerge from its fruity bubble on the tongue, the effect is almost liqueur-like. it’s a very pleasing dram, but the question is, is it caol ila?"
"cadenhead’s (distilled at caol ila) 29 year old, 53.2%",Single Malt Scotch,80,275,"quite hot on the nose, with a little oak on show here alongside garam masala. the effect is of dried fish and seaweed, brazil nut and bread basket. it needs water. in the mouth it’s tense when neat, giving you the sense of it straining to express itself fully but being constricted by alcohol. firm and bold, but even with water it’s a little too dry."
"signatory (distilled at dallas dhu), 26 year old, 1979 vintage, cask # 1391, 57.1%",Single Malt Scotch,80,200,"this speyside distillery was closed in 1983. very pale in color, mouth-coating, but not heavy or cloying. a clean whisky that emphasizes its sweeter notes, with honeyed malt, ripe barley, butterscotch, and vanilla. subtle notes of cinnamon, lemon grass, and fruit in syrup. a dried, oak-spice finish provides balance. 
"
"signatory 'unchillfiltered' (distilled at edradour), 10 year, 1992 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,80,65,"very fragrant and perfumed on the nose. chewy and syrupy on the palate, with layers of sweetness (toffee, caramel, fudge), roasted almonds, and raisins. a drying, resinous spice finish saves the sweetness from being too dominant. call me sentimental, but i just remembered the old campbell distillers 10 year old bottling which expressed so much more finesse, and was cleaner and not as heavy and cluttered. 
"
"signatory 'glencraig' (distilled at glenburgie), 30 year old, 1975 vintage, cask # 7938, 54.4%",Single Malt Scotch,80,200,"this glencraig, along with mosstowie (reviewed below), were experimentations with ""lomond"" stills, where the top of the stills were replaced with a rectifying column, allowing several different styles of whiskies to be produced at the same distillery. the lomond stills were eventually removed. this is a very creamy malt, with an oily texture. notes of bananas and cream, ripe barley, caramel, graham cracker, and orange creamsicle. dry, spicy finish. the fruity zing in this whisky shows that it still has some life in it. a dessert whisky indeed. 
"
"glenburgie 15 year old, 54.5%",Single Malt Scotch,80,54,"one of a trio from chivas bros., who every year release limited editions of 500 ml cask strength bottlings from a selection of its estates. these are predominantly only for sale on site or by mail order through www.maltwhiskydistilleries.com.

this distillery is located amongst the fertile barley-growing fields of the laich o’moray. though modern in look, it actually dates back to 1810. this is a classic introduction to its fresh, zesty style, which plays an important role in the ballantine’s blends. think cut grass, green apple, pine, pear drops, and a whiff of freshly-starched linen. this energy carries on to the mouth where apple is the dominant flavor, along with green walnut and a zippy acidity. £34 "
"glencadam the rather delicate 10 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,80,48,"fresh citrus notes and pear drops on the nose, plus a newly-opened packet of printer paper. the palate is quite full-bodied and fruity, with some white pepper. more citrus on the palate, with spicy, freshly-sawn wood. the finish is relatively long and fruity. uncomplicated, but a good introduction to the brand. £30"
"glendronach, 1993 vintage, 17 year old, oloroso sherry cask #529, 60.5%",Single Malt Scotch,80,104,"this isn’t the easiest to fall for. it’s stewed, swampy, a big, feisty, take-no-prisoners whisky with oxtail soup, spicy tomato and meat broth on the nose, then black treacle, praline, cayenne, and paprika. a rootsy prune juice is part of the finish. challenging and tough. £67 [dominic roskrow]"
"glenkinchie, 59.3%",Single Malt Scotch,80,97,"another whisky that will not disappoint fans of the brand, but it doesn’t do enough to bring any converts on board. the nose is fresh and sweet, with barley and ginger and not much else. the taste is perfectly acceptable, and at this strength better than the standard bottling. water brings out a sweet malt and barley core, some gentle spice, and a rich sweetness. "
"adelphi (distilled at the glenlivet) 1978 34 year old, 48.8%",Single Malt Scotch,80,160,"think of sponge fingers soaked in cream and you’re not far off the initial aroma. add in light macadamia-like nuttiness, a drift of mint, and glenlivet’s signature apple — core, not green. as it opens, it becomes woodier, like a brush pile. the palate has sweet, pure, pear-like fruit that initially keeps the oak in balance. it seems to need water, but when it’s added the oak takes over. good, but a little tired. £102"
"glenrothes, cask # 13458, 1979 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,80,995,"a single cask bottling of the glenrothes aged in a first-fill sherry cask. only 519 bottles, all destined for the u.s. it is the richest, chewiest, sweetest, and fruitiest of all the glenrothes whiskies reviewed here. deep mahogany color, with notes of toffee apples, waxed fruit, burnt orange, prunes in syrup, and dark chocolate. the intensity of the sherry and length of oak-aging gives the whisky a flavor profile that begins to transcend traditional whisky flavors, expressing notes of port wine, pot-still rum, and rancio. 
"
"ledaig, 10 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,80,48,"sweet, ripe barley, balanced by damp peat, tar, and burning embers. some spice notes (pepper, anise) linger on the finish. while enjoyable now, some of the flavors seem to behave more like individual solos, rather than harmony. i think they will begin to integrate nicely by the time this generation of ledaig reaches its teens. 
"
"highland park, cask #10140, 1990 vintage, 15 year old, 52.7%",Single Malt Scotch,80,75,"caramelized, fruity notes of mandarin, pineapple, golden raisin, and plum. heathery honey notes add an additional sweet dimension, as do some light toffee and nougat. a dusting of cocoa powder emerges occasionally. like the other 15 year olds, this one is quite sherried, thick, and heavy on the palate. (bottled for hi-time wine cellars) 
"
"trader joe's (distilled at imperial), 12 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,80,30,"a whisky very typical of this distillery, which has been silent since 1998. rich and thick on the nose and palate; oozing vanilla, ripe malt, cotton candy, powdered sugar, new-mown hay, and lemon tart. cinnamon, evergreen, and a wisp of smoke round out the palate. an evolving whisky -- starts out heavy and sweet, then turns clingingly dry. a fun, rare whisky for a reasonable price."
"inchmurrin, 12 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,80,62,"thick and syrupy on the palate. notes of marshmallow, creamy vanilla, caramel, honey drenched fruit, almond liqueur, and coconut macaroon. liquid dessert. 
"
"inchmurrin 18 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,80,150,"rich on the nose, with damp tweed, malt, and a suggestion of earthiness. finally, salted butter. the palate offers muted tropical fruits, soft gingery oak, and more earthiness. in the finish, the oak becomes more overt without dominating."
"inchmurrin madeira wood finish, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,80,90,"surprisingly the most reticent nose of the three inchmurrins. mild orchard fruit, apple blossom, cocoa powder, and a hint of nutmeg. initially, red grapes and almonds on the palate, with the fruit then darkening to raisins and developing oak. the finish is long, spicy, dry, and oaky, with persistent background fruitiness trying to break through."
"jura 10 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,80,40,"despite close proximity to islay, stylistically jura make has far more in common with its highland cousins. the entry level 10 year old variant offers resin, oil, cereal, and pine notes on the delicate nose. comparatively light bodied, with malt and drying saltiness in the mouth, along with a hint of aniseed. the finish is malty and nutty, with more salt, plus just a wisp of smoke."
"laphroaig px cask, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,80,94,"a mix of bourbon and quarter casks finished in pedro ximenez, this new release is, initially, only for travel retail. the problem with finishing peaty whiskies is that all you can do is reduce the smoke, but here it’s done with as much subtlety as you can when dealing with px. think treacle scones, raisins, and tarry tobacco. a thick mid-palate gives an effect like an old-fashioned medicine. a sweet-hearted dragon smoldering in its seashore cave. (travel retail exclusive) £60 "
"laphroaig cairdeas madeira cask, 51.6%",Single Malt Scotch,80,75,"the annual cairdeas release aims to show laphroaig in a new light. initially i thought this too sweet and cask dominated, with the distillery battling against the wine—fresh red fruit and seaweed is a test, even for the best chef. add water and give it time though, and there is this lightly exotic, herbal, hazelnut-like element. it lacks depth and the tarry thump beloved by many laphroaig lovers, but is an interesting departure."
"ledaig, 10 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,80,48,"sweet, ripe barley, balanced by damp peat, tar, and burning embers. some spice notes (pepper, anise) linger on the finish. while enjoyable now, some of the flavors seem to behave more like individual solos, rather than harmony. i think they will begin to integrate nicely by the time this generation of ledaig reaches its teens. 
"
"longmorn the distiller’s choice, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,80,68,"the latest in chivas bros. no age statement (nas) variant of their malts and while the nose here does have longmorn’s fruity elements, they are discreet. this is also the case on the palate, where what is usually thick, elegant, and fruity has had its volume turned down. blind, it’s a nice dram, but i don’t want nice from longmorn, i want great. £47"
"the macallan, 1841 replica bottling, 41.7%",Single Malt Scotch,80,190,"style: speyside single malt scotch color: gold aroma: fresh and youthful. citrus fruit, honey, vanilla, ginger, and a hint of smoke. palate: youthful and on the light side for a macallan. notes of citrus, ginger root, honey and smoke. the whisky finishes rather quicky. 
"
"duncan taylor dimensions range (distilled at mortlach) 1989, 55.8%",Single Malt Scotch,80,201,"there’s a roman dish involving lamb cooked in milk, and this is it in alcohol form. a slightly peculiar lactic note rises and falls above the rich meatiness of the spirit. there’s a hit of pencil shavings, but with water it becomes cheesy. so much more straightforward on the tongue with good vinous weight, like an old vin jaune. it finishes with earthy tones. it’s just…odd. £125"
"duncan taylor 'rarest of the rare' (distilled at north port), cask #774, 24 year old, 1981 vintage, 58.0%",Single Malt Scotch,80,225,"very pale in color. a creamy, mouthcoating whisky, with thick vanilla as the main thread. quite dry, given its creaminess. i’m also picking up a lot of gin botanicals (especially juniper and orange peel). an interesting enough of a dram, but not something i would drink on a regular basis. 
"
"gordon & macphail single cask #1535 (distilled at rosebank) 1991 vintage, 59.2% abv",Single Malt Scotch,80,80,"a very traditional rosebank-aged in a refill hogshead and bottled fairly young (12 years old). rosebank is one of the better, yet lesser known lowland single malts. since the distillery was closed down in 1993, it will continue being unfamiliar to most, and finding young rosebanks like this one will become increasingly more difficult. here’s one at cask strength. the whisky turns very cloudy with the addition of water due to lack of chill filtering, but the additional water brings out the whisky’s subtle aromas and flavors-fresh cut grass, hay, delicate fruit, and a gentle malty sweetness. ironically, i actually enjoyed some of the recent young g&m rosebanks bottled at 40% abv better than this one-their flavors were cleaner, brighter, and more refined. still, this is a fair representation of the lowland style. 
"
"scapa skiren, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,80,60,"a new nas expression from scapa on orkney, matured entirely in first-fill american oak casks. an initial hint of lime cordial, then musty peaches, almonds, cinnamon, and table salt. more peaches on the palate, with tinned pear and a little honey. tingling spices in the drying finish, which soon becomes quite bitter – detracting from the overall balance."
"springbank, cask #97/613, 1997 vintage, 10 year old, 58.2%",Single Malt Scotch,80,75,"aged in a re-charred sherry butt. sweet, but not cloying, with plenty of fruit throughout. toffee, vanilla fudge, roasted chestnuts, and nougat, enhanced by glazed peaches, burnt pineapple, dark cherry pits, and subtle anise. gripping charred oak tannins emerge mid-palate and continue on the finish detracting from an otherwise very pleasant experience. (bottled exclusively for binny’s beverage depot)
"
"douglas laing provenance young & feisty (distilled at talisker), 46%",Single Malt Scotch,80,110,"douglas laing has added a no age statement bottling of talisker to its provenance range, tagging it as “young and feisty.” it comprises whisky from casks #10227 and 10229. lively and up front, with bubblegum, wood smoke, and black pepper on the nose. developing ozone. zesty soft fruits, emerging dark peat notes, and more pepper on the palate. the finish is quite short, nutty, and slightly metallic. young and feisty indeed! £65"
"douglas laing provenance (distilled at talisker) 6 year old 2008, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,80,85,"a single cask (#10699) bottling of talisker, distilled in the winter of 2008 and matured in a refill hogshead before bottling in may 2015. initially, a slight hint of new make, soon displaced by digestive biscuits, brine, and black pepper. sweet oak, earthy peat, and orchard fruits on the palate. the finish is medium in length, with black coffee, licorice, and long-lasting spices."
"tomatin 12 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,80,25,"pleasantly sweet. good malt foundation with an abundance of bright summer fruit. clean, straight-forward and uncomplicated.
"
"tormore 14 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,80,55,"light amber. the nose offers up walnut bread, spelt flour, and a green, malty note. overall, it’s slightly unyielding, with toasted oak, hazelnut, and barley. water opens up a sweeter core: lucozade, apricot kernel, and barley. the palate is where the apricot flesh turns up, but then it firms up quickly, snuffing that moment of levity out. water introduces lemon before it becomes very gingery on the finish. it’s the thing about tormore; it just can’t let itself go. (france only) €42"
"the antiquary, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,80,20,"this venerable blend has a nose of mandarin syrup cake, vanilla cream, and cut hay, with chopped cilantro and other herbal top notes. sweet and fruity, though verging on tasting of artificial sweeteners at times, there are malt notes and a developing butteriness, with sweet mandarin notes and sponge cake. it all hangs on a light structure but it’s less smooth on the finish, with a scratch of wood smoke."
"cutty sark blended malt, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,80,30,"remarkably light and drinkable for an all-malt product. malty foundation with citrus (lemon zest, tangerine sherbet) shining through, along with vanilla wafer, white chocolate, coconut, ginger, and cut grass. a worthy “bridge whisky” for blended whisky drinkers curious about malt whisky, but single malt whisky drinkers might want more individuality. a whisky for a warm, lazy afternoon.
"
"wemyss malts (distilled at bowmore) 1982 lochindaal catch, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,80,1113,"a slightly perfumed nose offers up the slightly unusual pairing of dried lavender, sweet-cured herring, and then potpourri air freshener. this flies off to show wet dulse on warm sand. it starts sweetly with some nutmeg, then hot peppers. the smoke is very light, allowing a tantalizing glimpse of soft guava before the salinity returns. water brings out the peat kiln but also that initial perfume. muddled. £700"
"wemyss malts (distilled at caol ila) 1982 smoke on the water, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,80,215,"quite a solid start for a caol ila which, like the 30 year old (see above), pitches you into the farmyard, though this time it’s a sheep-shearing shed. there’s also some bacon and spent barbecue. the initial impression is of a pretty dry example, but some oil begins to seep through. the palate is explosive with some engine oil, becoming pretty flinty with violet notes, and the distillery sweetness is hidden. a little disjointed. £135"
"wemyss the spice king 12 year old, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,80,55,"the least assertive of the wemyss 12 year old range, and the most flighty. there's nothing wrong here, and the whisky's well-made and won't disappoint, but when you compare the spice hit here with what's on offer with other malts, this isn't shouting loudly enough. £35"
"port askaig 30 year old cask strength, 51.1%",Single Malt Scotch,80,302,"the oldest of the new trio, here you can see how the smoke has become fully absorbed, accenting the peapod and spearmint, giving depth to the still-fresh ozonic elements. there are light levels of complexity, even a little chocolate. the tongue, when neat, goes deep into pear and apple, but it’s edgy. adding water, however, shows the lack of oak integration. i’d want more from a whisky of this age (and price). £199"
"port askaig, 19 year old cask strength, 50.4%",Single Malt Scotch,80,122,"as with the 30 year old, here you get the sense of smoke being absorbed rather than being expressive. there’s not a lot of cask at work here—this has real minerality, and an oily brininess bringing to mind a hot outboard motor on a fishing trip. halfway in a fire ignites, sending clouds of smoke forward, but then it dries too quickly. good, but just not enough oak to give it depth and length. £80"
"royal lochnagar distillers edition 1998, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,80,75,"one of the newest of the distillers edition family. here, royal lochnagar has been given its secondary resting period in muscat casks. that nodule of sweetness in the 12 year old has been picked up and extended into a more perfumed world; think blueberry muffin and boysenberry jam. the slight sour/bitter note is a positive, but i think in this case that the finish dominates proceedings and needs to be scaled down a little. £48"
"glen moray peated spirit batch #1 cask 141, 60.6%",Single Malt Scotch,80,28,"another glen moray, this time in a substantially different guise than normal. yes, this is fresh, sweet, and malty — to be precise, draff-like — but there’s smoke as well, and a fairly decent belt of it. young it may be — amazingly it’s less than 2 years old — but the palate, especially with water, is cleansing and with vanilla, good phenols, and orris-like dryness. very intriguing. £18 (200 ml)"
"glen moray elgin classic, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,80,56,"the onionskin hue gives the initial indication that this was finished in a port pipe. the nose is light and fruity: raspberry and cranberry juice, even a sprig of mint. fresh, but with a background funkiness. in time, there’s ripe melon, then lightly musty wood comes through. the palate is light, giving the effect of diluted fruit juice. it’s all just a bit lacking in weight. £25"
"singleton of glen ord signature, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,80,65,"signature was new to the singleton of glen ord range in 2013 as part of the travel retail exclusive singleton reserve collection. soft toffee, banana, and ginger on the nose accompanied by slightly herbal and pine notes. sweet and easy-drinking, with a suggestion of sherry and drying oak. licorice in the finish. rm263"
"the singleton of glendullan double matured, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,80,89,"the double maturation here is a vatting of bourbon and sherry casks finished off in what diageo will only say is a “special” cask. that’s helpful. there’s a breakfast-style opening here of warm bagels with grape jelly, then comes citrus, before some of that dusky distillery character creeps in. it’s quite bulked-up in the center of the palate, but finishes cleanly. one for those who like things on the thick-set side. (travel retail exclusive)"
"master of malt speyside single malt 40 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,80,220,"a similar story to the 30 year old. despite a truly excellent nose, this time more sherry influences dominate: think of polished wood, damsons, and a little menthol/camphor and resinous oak. once again, the palate seems to be slightly dumber than i’d want from a venerable whisky that should be about elegant, complex expression. it’s balanced, just a little faded. again, maybe higher strength might have done the trick. £140"
"clan denny (distilled at girvan) 21 year old 1993, 51.8%",Single Grain Whisky,80,117,"unmistakably grainy in character, this offers aromas of pink lemonade dubble bubble, faint vanilla, confectioner’s sugar, and mild herbal tones. its redeeming qualities are the good thick texture and creamy, buttery feeling in the mouth. sparkling orange and processed raspberry and strawberry flavors are hit by a surge of pepper and clove, which subsides to allow some late herbal notes to creep in. the finish has a heavy clove note. file this as a grain enthusiast’s grain whisky. £81"
"double barrel caol ila/tamdhu, 46%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,80,49,"the weakest of the double barrel trio on offer, this has a slightly spirity nose with a somewhat unpleasant off note, but the taste promises more than the nose delivers. the oily, peaty caol ila is seemingly held in check by the tamdhu on the one hand, while the fresh, zingy, sherbet-like characteristics of tamdhu are tantalizingly faint. in the end, pepper and peat dominate.€40"
"that boutique-y whisky company (distilled at invergordon) batch 2, 58.3%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,80,114,"despite the high strength, the aromas strike the nose like a pillow in slow motion. greengages, corn, and ripening lemons lift from the glass. it’s a thick, unctuous, layered mouthful with honey, gooseberry, and lemon acidity, though a splash of water produces softer notes of scottish tablet and evaporated milk. a little sourness in the finish. sure, part of the allure of boutique-y whisky is the batch variations, but this is quite a different beast from the magnificent batch 1. £72"
"douglas laing old particular (distilled at bunnahabhain) 16 year old, 48.4%",Single Malt Scotch,80,105,"light gold. fresh and clean, with light draff notes. cool porcelain, lemon, cereal husk. it becomes more expressive on the tongue, though it remains subtle. a bit of a stealth bomb because the palate shows plenty of spice, cinnamon toast, and baklava. the finish reveals some green notes. when you add water, it becomes incredibly minty. fragile, but if you fancy a bunna' julep, then look no further. £69"
"douglas laing old particular (distilled at tamdhu) 16 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,80,101,"pale straw. the nose is very draff-like/sweet mash, then green herbal notes, reminiscent of angelica. the palate remains light and slightly hot on the tongue, with some cereal and a certain fatness. water brings out a little more from the cask. a delicate and pleasant enough dram, but i’m slightly bemused as to why it’s being bottled at this age when there’s clearly so much more to give. £69"
"douglas laing provenance (distilled at mortlach) 8 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,80,66,"very pale straw. the color indicates that there’s been no real cask activity. a little closed on the nose to start; clean, quite green and leafy (young ferns). the flavor however, makes up for this, with good mid-palate sweetness and some dark fruits beginning to assemble themselves in the middle. of interest to completists. £45"
"douglas laing premier barrel (distilled at glengoyne) 7 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,80,95,"another youthful offering from douglas laing in its premier barrel series, presented in one of 863 ceramic decanters. this glengoyne initially offers a nose of cherries and treacle before tinned tomatoes make their presence felt. tangy fruits on the palate, malt, and spicy sausage. caramel, spices, and a hint of oak in the finish. an interesting contrast to the older, more sherry cask-focused glengoyne ‘house’ bottlings. £65"
"douglas laing premier barrel (distilled at talisker) 5 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,80,110,"following a similarly youthful provenance range bottling of talisker, and an nas “young and feisty” variant, douglas laing has opted to release this 5 year old expression in its premier barrel lineup, complete with ceramic decanter, 495 of which were produced. initially meaty, then peat smoke envelops the nose, with damp tweed backing it up. black pepper and gunpowder tea on the bold palate; flinty, with lemon and lime. lingering black pepper and a metallic tang in the finish. £75"
"the epicurean, 46.2%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,80,44,"this is the lowland entry into douglas laing’s remarkable regional malts collection, and on approach the nose is like sipping lemonade in a malt hopper: gristy malt, lemon, lime, honeydew melon, vanilla pods, peach, and apricot. a similarly juicy palate, gaining sweet grassy notes, spangles, and confectioners’ sugar, before ending on a finish of dried citrus and fizzy refreshers. true to the region, but the epicurean makes the rest of the range look brighter, quicker, smarter, and tastier in comparison. £34"
"single malts of scotland (distilled at glenallachie) 1992, 47.9%",Single Malt Scotch,80,105,"there is something very bedtime drink about this glenallachie, without it being a dram to have before retiring for the night. it’s to do with the aromatic sensation of powdered malted milk and cocoa powder. the palate is simple, with some fresh apple, pear juice, and a lightly sour edge. the draff/malted milk re-emerges in the middle of the tongue. with water, pears come through, making it similar to a tequila blanco. all rather delicate. £63"
"the sovereign (distilled at port dundas) 25 year old 1990, 51.9%",Single Grain Whisky,80,119,"vicks inhaler (menthol, camphor, and pine needle oil), freshly unwrapped sticks of spearmint gum, cilantro, and root ginger make for a stimulating, if not exactly charming olfactory experience. mouth-filling and structured with good weight, this has sweet orange and a mild gingery glow. although there are fleeting vegetal notes, it stays just sweet of the middle. close heat on the finish, saturating the taste buds with spice and dark citrus. £83"
"the sovereign (distilled at invergordon) 50 year old, 42.9%",Single Grain Whisky,80,300,"you can smell the time that has elapsed on this dark, chestnut dram. glimpses of vanilla essence, mushroom gills, blueberries, aged balsamic vinegar, and beef stock. flavors swirl around charred meat juices, walnut oil, chewed leather, rancio, tobacco leaf, tree bark, black toffee, and licorice root. a slight creamy salvation tugs it from its oaky and savory comfort zone. the moderate finish is awash with brazil nut and bitter coffee grounds. forget about adding water. an ancient, fragile grain whisky. (k&l wines exclusive)"
"glenkeir treasures (distilled at fettercairn) 6 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,80,53,"this could be seen as a brave young bottling of the sometimes divisive fettercairn single malt, but glenkeir treasures has acquired some interesting casks which showcase the youthful whisky to good advantage. wet cardboard, starch, and savory notes on the initial nose, settling down to something fruitier and with milk chocolate. floral, nutty, and slightly peppery on the palate, with almonds, toffee, cocoa powder, and gentle citrus fruit. quite soft in the finish, with elegant spices and milky coffee. (whisky shop only) £35/500 ml"
"cadenhead’s (distilled at dailuaine) 1996, 57.5%",Single Malt Scotch,80,140,"like being stuck inside the dailuaine dark grains plant: all marmite (yeast extract spread), deglazed roasting pan, and a cereal note. in other words, the distillery character is the major contributor. some light nuttiness, but overall this is dailuaine in funky guise. becomes more, errr…agricultural with water. robust and peppery on the tongue. a nice example, albeit without massive complexity."
"deveron 10 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,80,24,"this expression from macduff distillery was launched along with its 12 and 18 year old siblings in 2015. the nose is fresh and floral and offers light cereal notes and soft malt. the palate yields new-mown hay, toffee apples, and quite sweet oak. the finish is medium in length and softly spiced. (france only) €21"
"borders, 51.7%",Single Grain Whisky,80,72,"a single grain whisky made equally from wheat and barley to keep you amused until r&b distillers builds their new distilleries. the first impression created by the oloroso cask finish is an abundance of fruit sugar sweetness; cherry, raspberry, plus freshly picked mint leaves. this is a bold, muscular, assertive grain, where the juicy fruit is soured by aniseed, licorice, and toasted walnut. notes of dried apple accompany a hot, drying finish. water straightens it all out though. £50"
"bruichladdich octomore ‘comus’ 4.2 2007 5 year old, 61%",Single Malt Scotch,80,200,"comus is the name of a frankly terrifying english folk group who taps into the dark, pagan spirit underpinning that music. an apposite name then for the laddie’s most heavily-peated variant. if you want to know what it’s like to stand beside a kiln, then sniff this, but the distillery’s sweetness is retained, here in the guise of pineapple and banana. the palate is like eucalyptus lozenges, with light maltiness before that laddie thickness makes things even sweeter."
"macqueen’s 3 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,80,13,"macqueen’s has an impressive range of age statement blends, but this is the youngest one. faint caramel and toast, a mild rub of whole spice, and snuff tobacco. the mouthfeel is meager and lacks any real punch; there is spice and fudge, but little sweetness. more caramel flavors develop alongside chocolate notes before a dry, quick finish. there are better options around, even at this price."
"duncan taylor rare auld (distilled at aberlour) 1993 18 year old, 54.4%",Single Malt Scotch,79,105,"shy is the word. pale in color, again suggestive of little cask interaction. there’s a little hint of white currant and light cereal, delicate and fragile — more fragile than the balmenach — with a little touch of white chocolate. as it opens, out comes violet. the mouth is tense, as if everything is still baled up, even after all this time. very light acidity gives a certain freshness that water doesn’t shake loose. simply not enough cask. £67"
"master of malt darkness! ardbeg 21 year old px cask finish, 40.1%",Single Malt Scotch,79,202,"finishing in octave-sized px casks has resulted in the creation of an oddity: the world’s first ardbeg cordial. there’s smoke, pigskin leather, and a sudden rootiness, mixed with damp woodland, stewing victoria plums, and a weirdly lactic note. this continues on the tongue, giving an effect like smoked cream cheese dotted with raisins. hmm…£120/500 ml"
"auchentoshan 17 year old, bordeaux wine finish, 51%",Single Malt Scotch,79,120,"a peculiar auchentoshan. the bordeaux wine dominates, with its distinctive winery aroma and flavor. red raspberry, red currant, and a hint of strawberry comprise the core of this whisky, with underlying notes of vanilla cream, cocoa, and a hint of demerara rum. the whisky spent nine of its years in bordeaux wine casks. i would have preferred less time in the wine casks for such a delicate whisky. 
"
"gordon & macphail (distilled at banff), 28 year old, 1976 vintage, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,79,150,"dominant notes of citrus (lemon, lime) and other tropical fruits (coconut, mango) on the nose. on the palate, the whisky is simple and uncomplicated. the entry is soft and malty, and then it becomes dry and gently oaky. not overly inspiring, but those who purchase the whisky for its rarity value (the distillery closed in 1983), shouldn’t be discouraged from actually drinking the stuff some day. 
"
"bruichladdich, 16 year old, 1989 vintage, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,79,80,"aged in bourbon oak and then finished in guigal hermitage rouge syrah wine casks. bright notes of red raspberry, rhubarb, currant, plum, and (not surprisingly) grape, with background notes of vanilla and caramel. i find the syrah notes entertaining on the nose, but too dominant on the palate for balance. the fruit becomes waxy and hides a lot of bruichladdich subtle complexities. (bottled exclusively for the party source.) 
"
"signatory (distilled at caol ila), 15 year old, 1991 vintage, cask #06/324/1&2, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,79,55,"very pale. a little thin in body, sharp and penetrating. very caol ila-like, with notes of damp peat, greek olives, seaweed, mustard seed, incense, gin herbs, freshly ground pepper, and vanilla malt. smoldering peat finish. i would like to see more body to this whisky.

"gordon & macphail (distilled at caol ila), cask #12903, 1998 vintage, 8 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,79,65,"not immature, but very intense and unabashed. sweet barley notes and vanilla are beaten up by coal tar, damp kiln smoke, and fiery spice on the finish. for those who like their islay whiskies young. very young. i would have waited a couple more years before bottling this one. pure testosterone. (bottled for maxwell street trading co.)
"
"glen spey 21 year old, 50.4%",Single Malt Scotch,79,185,"somewhat sidelined thanks to the presence of glenrothes and glen grant (not to mention speyburn) in the same village, glen spey gets on with producing fillings for numerous diageo blends (primarily j&b). as a result, it’s rarely seen as a single malt, with even independent bottlings pretty thin on the ground.
this 21 year old is the color of old gold, and while the nose initially surprises with a hint of suet dumplings, there’s a rich and dangerously hedonistic sweetness behind, which is strangely hard to pin down. coconut cream? suntan lotion? blackening butter in a frying pan? eventually it appears to settle in the crème brûlée area, along with a fruity base (sweet, of course). there’s a light green note that suggests it might be distillery character coming through, but water suggests it’s new wood. 
in the mouth, there’s vanilla fudge and toffee, before a hint of muesli alongside dried mango. overall it’s a bit like eating breakfast in a new ski chalet. showy and impressive, but for me the wood’s in charge. "
"glenfarclas family cask 1961 (cask 1325), 47%",Single Malt Scotch,79,1318,"this is coming from a first fill sherry hogshead, so there’s little surprise that the color is as dark as pitch. this is glenfarclas at its most concentrated; less about dried fruit and more about highly-roasted espresso with a glass of ancient marsala on the side. the palate shows firm grip moving into astringency. too much cask for me, but if this is what rocks your boat, go for it! £840"
"gordon & macphail private collection: the glenlivet decades 1974, 50.1%",Single Malt Scotch,79,820,"a quintet of releases showing examples of the glenlivet from five decades, issued to support the glenlivet generations 70 year old bottling. all are available individually or in a limited edition set (50 only) for £2,850; these bottlings are not currently available in the u.s.

the nose immediately betrays the fact that this has been matured in a first-fill sherry hogshead. it’s akin to an artisan’s workshop, all leather oil and strange resins. there’s an intriguing hint of curry spices and truffle, but all in all this is about density, black fruits (damson), allspice, and clove. the cask is in charge. the palate has more tannin than you perhaps want — powerful and grippy with lots of nut and tea-like tannins; too grippy for me. £500 "
"glenmorangie lasanta, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,79,65,"finished in sherry casks. the sherry adds a nutty toffee sweetness, bramble, and other assorted red fruit and raisin, with the tell-tale glenmorangie complexity tucked underneath. a bit heavy on the sherry, though, for such a subtle spirit.
"
"glenrothes peated cask reserve, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,79,61,"a 1992 ‘rothes finished in a peated cask, this shows immediate smoke along with some cellar notes. behind is some laurel and a light lemon touch. it has surprising intensity. it’s all very clean and fresh, but while the smoke is there it wanders about in a somewhat distracted fashion. like the recent glenlivet peated cask offering it just lacks integration. maybe if you want smoke, you should peat the barley. who’da thunk it? £42"
"highland park, cask #10132, 1990 vintage, 15 year old, 56.3%",Single Malt Scotch,79,80,"lushly fruity and quite sweet. a bit too sappy on the nose, but more even-keeled on the palate. the fruit notes (nectarine, plum, orange marmalade) sit on a bed of caramel, shortbread, and thick honey, with chocolate-covered almonds emerging on the finish. for those who like their highland park youthful and very sherried. (bottled for grape vine market) 
"
"highland park, 24 year old, 1980 vintage, 58%",Single Malt Scotch,79,185,"this whisky is not as good as the similarly-aged, more polished and refined, standard distillery-bottled 25 year old cask-strength expression (our ""whisky of the year"" several years ago). this single cask bottling from a sherry cask is intensely sherried. sappy fruit notes dominate the palate. damp, somewhat tired, oak notes are prevalent throughout. the whisky is also nutty, with heathery peat notes emerging occasionally. the floral, heather-honeyed grace treasured in highland park struggles to emerge, and ultimately loses the battle. (bottled exclusively for park avenue liquors.) 
"
"highland park, 19 year old, 1986 vintage, 53.8%",Single Malt Scotch,79,120,"rich and viscous in texture. sappy waxed fruit, maple syrup, and nougat. becoming quite nutty with emerging notes of damp peat, dates, plum and blueberry. the sherry is fairly dominant and masks some of the whisky's subtleties. after dinner with a cigar, perhaps? (bottled exclusively for beltramo's.)"
"inchmurrin 18 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,79,108,"inchmurrin has enjoyed a higher profile since early 2013, when the range was extended to include 15, 18, and 21 year old
expressions. the lineup also boasts striking new packaging and is bottled non-chill filtered. orange fondant cream and peaches on the nose, with caramel in the background. fuller-bodied than the 15 year old expression, with pineapple cheesecake and ginger on the palate. the finish is quite long, and spicier and more peppery than that of the 15 year old bottling (also reviewed this issue). £70"
"isle of jura, 21 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,79,130,"jura’s newest offering, and the oldest in the portfolio. it is drastically different than its younger siblings-this one is quite sherried, as its deep amber color with reddish hues suggests. i really enjoy how this whisky tastes on the palate-it’s rich and silky with notes of fruitcake, toffee, maple, orange chocolate truffle, cinnamon, and nutmeg. you’ll find the same notes on the nose, but there are also elements-cloying fruit, perfume, and a peculiar fleshy component-which detract from an otherwise lovely whisky. 
"
"ledaig sherry finish, 42%",Single Malt Scotch,79,33,"there’s no age statement, but the whisky is less than 10 years old -- and is a little green. notes of toffee almonds, ripe fruit, freshly-ground pepper, chorizo, bacon fat, and damp peat smoke. lingering smoke and brine on the finish. a few more years of maturation should improve this whisky significantly."
"littlemill, 12 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,79,62,"quite palate-coating for a lowlander, with sweet notes of vanilla malt, grist, honey and marshmallow. more subtle notes of cut grass, linseed oil, rubber erasers, and chalky antacid tablets. a peculiar-tasting whisky. 
"
"gordon & macphail (distilled at rosebank), cask #1536, 1991 vintage, 13 year old, 59.3%",Single Malt Scotch,79,100,"matured in a refill sherry cask. (a first-fill sherry cask would have completely dominated rosebank’s delicate flavor profile.) with the addition of water (which is necessary), the whisky becomes quite cloudy. rosebank’s traditional honeyed vanilla, grass/hay, and soft fruit are accentuated by lightly sherried, soft toffee flavors. an interesting whisky, but the flavors are not clean and well-defined enough to warrant a higher rating.
"
"tomatin,12 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,79,27,"enjoyable creamy texture and medium-bodied. gently sweet notes of light toffee and vanilla custard, especially towards the front of the palate. nutty too, with some sultana in the background. gentle oak notes towards the finish. a very clean, well-balanced whisky that’s very easy to drink but also takes few risks. 
"
"tomatin, 25 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,79,125,"plenty of citrus zest, along with subtle pineapple and coconut on the nose. the palate begins with honeyed-malt sweetness, followed by the citrus fruit, but then quickly turns dry and resinous, with dried nuts and spicy oak on the finish. the intensity of the dryness on the finish surprised me and detracted from an otherwise well-rounded dram. 
"
"tormore 16 year old, 48%",Single Malt Scotch,79,75,"amber in hue, this starts off very succulent and approachable, with some butterscotch, vanilla, and caramel toffee, but like its brother, it dries. the palate is lighter than the 14 year old, and seems to float, lacking an anchor. when it does come down, it does so with a cereal crunch. water lightens it still further, just leaving a mix of oak and cereal, and an astringent finish. (france only) €56"
"wemyss vintage malts 'the smooth gentleman,' 8 year old, 40%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,79,40,"indeed smooth, and malty, with vanilla, shortbread, golden raisin, and macadamia nuts. light oak spice emerges on a fairly quick finish. (it is only 8 years old, after all.) pleasant and easy-going.
"
"port askaig 19 year old, 58.6%",Single Malt Scotch,79,96,"london-based specialist the whisky exchange won’t reveal where its main islay brand is distilled, though the smart money is on a distillery not that far away from the ferry terminal that gives it its name. this expression is less phenolic than you might expect; there’s more rapeseed oil than smoke, but it does have a nori wrap shoreline character. the palate is discreet, with pineapple and creaminess leading the way toward a bonfire made of old fishboxes. £60"
"islay mist, 8 year old, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,79,24,"the nice thing about islay whiskies is that they often show their true nature better at a younger age. malty sweet and incredibly herbal (almost gin-like), with emerging tar, smoked seaweed, and olive. medicinal in nature, with lingering tar and brine on the finish. fairly straight-forward (what do you expect for 8 years old?) but a pretty decent showing for a whisky this young."
"the singleton of dufftown 28 year old, 52.3%",Single Malt Scotch,79,455,"bottled as one of last year’s diageo special releases, this is very minty to start: mint chocolate to be precise, before brazil nut and toasted bran appear, given balance by creamy oak. this mix of nuts and sweetness continues on the tongue alongside an early burst of strawberry, but the center and back palate are foosty (as we say in scotland), or dusty, as you probably do."
"clan denny (distilled at girvan) 1992 21 year old hh9451, 59.6%",Single Grain Whisky,79,108,"a sweet, aromatic nose, with fresh cream, flaked almonds, macaroons, pomegranate juice, and a veneer of vanilla from this refill barrel. the palate starts warm and sweet, then revs up to full power; light butterscotch, cotton candy, clementine, toledo marzipan, and corn kernels, with a hint of fresh green salad leaves. the short finish picks over corn, cake mix, and cream soda. power, but not enough finesse from the wood here. £64"
"douglas laing single minded (distilled at jura) 8 year old, 41.5%",Single Malt Scotch,79,48,"bottled as part of douglas laing’s single minded range, which focuses on young small batch bottlings, this 8 year old jura matured in two refill sherry butts after being distilled in april 2006. pear drops, pine nuts, and damp woodland on the nose. the palate is light and fruity, though dark spices and aniseed soon emerge. peppery oak in the dry finish. £33"
"single malts of scotland (distilled at craigellachie) 1996, 52.7%",Single Malt Scotch,79,100,"craigellachie is one of scotland’s most interesting distilleries: its worm tubs providing a deliberately sulfury new make whose aromas flash off after maturation to reveal a deeply floral, pineapple-accented palate. here, sadly, an inactive cask has meant that cabbagey sulfur has not been fully worked out. the fleshiness of the mature spirit is emerging, but this should have been kept in cask for another five years or so. lacks balance and maturity. £60"
"high commissioner, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,79,15,"you’re familiar with those generic blended scotch whiskies of debatable origin with an inoffensive flavor profile, right? this isn’t one of those. with aromas of the fruit and foliage of an orange grove, beeswax, and a grassy note, this is a juicy, citrus-led dram that puffs out in the mouth, bringing a tingle of light pepper, ginger, and thick fudge. despite the thinner mouthfeel, the baked orange and bitter seville orange on the finish give it some bite. perfectly serviceable."
"the arran malt, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,78,40,"bright gold color. sweet pear, caramel apples, vanilla, and fudge on the nose. light to medium in body. on the palate, there is more fruit (pear, citrus) and sweet malt (vanilla, caramel, and toffee), with a gently sweet finish.
   style: highland (isle of arran) single malt scotch whisky. price: high $30s. available nationwide. 
   again there is no age statement, and this one is still on the youthful side, but it is richer (some sherry cask aging in the mix?) and expresses more flavors-and deeper flavors-than the one mentioned above. it is still quite young, but it tastes more mature than its age (which is probably six years at the most). there's not much island character here. "
"bowmore, 16 year old, 1990 vintage, 53.8%",Single Malt Scotch,78,85,"a sherry cask-matured bowmore. introduced as ""the brother"" to the 1989 vintage bowmore released about a year ago (aged in bourbon casks). notes of waxed fruit, dates, fruitcake, and raisin permeate through tarry rope, leather boots, wet socks, and ripe peat. underlying notes of demerara rum, chocolate-covered coffee beans, and sea salt. a hedonistic bowmore with an earthy, rustic demeanor. (1,800 bottles for the u.s.) 
"
"bruichladdich 'waves', 46%",Single Malt Scotch,78,60,"only moderately peated (15ppm phenol), but a consistent influence. quite fresh: reminds me of a walk around a traditional distillery, with notes of steeping barley, kiln smoke, and youthful spirit. a subtle, intriguing thread of gin botanicals (especially citrus peel) weaves its way through the palate. otherwise, the smoke and fruit keep your attention.
"
"inchmurrin 15 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,78,77,"inchmurrin is one of many single malts produced by loch lomond. it is made using lightly peated malt and matured in bourbon casks, and is named after one of the islands in loch lomond. caramac chocolate and peanut butter on the sweet, fruity nose. the fruit motif continues on to the palate, where spicy malt, vanilla, and ripe peaches predominate. the finish is medium in length and nutty. £50"
"signatory 'unchillfiltered' (distilled at linkwood), 14 year old, 1990 vintage, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,78,43,"obviously aged in a sherry cask. juicy fruit, syrupy, a bit waxy, notes of maple syrup and spice (clove, mint). nicely soothing, but there is a trade-off here-the soft, floral beauty which makes linkwood malt so attractive is lost somewhere behind the sherry and escapes only briefly from time to time. (bottled exclusively for binny’s beverage depot.) 
"
"the maltman (distilled at linkwood) 18 year old port finish, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,78,119,"light onionskin color; the nose is scented with red fruits, cranberry sauce, hawthorn jelly, and red apple. with water there’s some bletted medlars mixed with lemon. sadly, the palate is soapy to start with, before the super-ripe red fruits come through. water makes things fresher, but overall it lacks personality."
"longrow tokaji wood, 10 year old, 55.6%",Single Malt Scotch,78,110,"i have tasted many superb longrow whiskies in the past 15 years (not to mention some wonderful tokaji dessert wines). this isn’t one of them. longrow is an assertive whisky, and i can see the logic of finishing the whisky in an equally big hungarian wine. the flavors are equal in intensity -- and this is certainly a dynamic whisky -- but they just don’t integrate well. you’ll find notes of waxed fruit, raisin, ripe barley, smoked fig, and toffee. cloying, waxy finish."
"kilchoman single cask sherry cask (cask #85), 57.9%",Single Malt Scotch,78,130,"distilled at the start of 2009, this special edition was bottled mid-2014, making it a 5 ½ year old whisky. the nose is ashy paste with a good measure of barnyard funk along with sherry, oak, and clove spice. the entry is all ashtray, a late night of sweet wine and cigarettes. sherry notes fight the smoke to emerge, but the smoke simply dominates. a smoky, ashy, spicy, and dry finish round out a face-slapper of a whisky. (u.s. only)"
"duncan taylor rare auld (distilled at glen moray) 1986 24 year old, 55.6%",Single Malt Scotch,78,110,"touches of acetone and magic marker/solvent suggest that there’s precious little cask involvement going on here. pleasing enough, with lime jelly and kiwi fruits, and a little whiff of sweet oak, but it’s very understated. in the mouth, it performs in a nutty way but doesn’t seem to have moved much over its quarter of a century sequestration. there is some horchata and brazil nut, even a mashy note, but it either needs more time or a kick to get it moving. £70"
"that boutique-y whisky company blended malt #2 (batch 2), 43.1%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,78,144,"caramel wafers, white pepper, pumice stone, and strands of caramel on the nose, but this is not a whisky bursting with personality. a sip brings cocoa and chocolate flavors which meld into an herb garden bouquet. a thin mouthfeel and rather linear flavor development make this seem rather ordinary, not a word i normally associate with this idiosyncratic range. the finish is redolent of marble cake. not a patch on the superb batch 1 in my book. (415 bottles) £100"
"that boutique-y whisky company (distilled at north british; batch 2), 49.3%",Grain Scotch Whisky,78,95,"papier mâché, adhesives, lemongrass, green cardamom, peanut, pear, and other aromatic, fruity characteristics create a puzzling aroma profile. on sipping, there is fruity baked apple, sherbet, and glowing light citrus notes of orange, grapefruit, and lime, with a medium weight structure. the flavors tip toward a slight sour fruit note, but as this flattens out, creaminess rules. the finish suffers a short, quick death, leaving mild, sour fruit. water brings crystallized lemon on the nose and sweeter, light fruits. £63"
"douglas laing old particular (distilled at strathclyde) 10 year old 2005, 50.9%",Single Grain Whisky,78,57,"one might speculate about the initial qualities of this young grain prior to its sherry cask finish. while it boasts a richer color, the nose is reminiscent of roast beef, plasticine, wet dog, and bruised raspberries. in the mouth, it has good weight, though mouth puckering, with some brief rubbery notes early on before showing strawberry bubblegum, sugar crystals, black cherry, rhubarb, faint coffee notes, and an ever-growing pepperiness. an enjoyable finish of baked apple and star anise. (727 bottles) £44"
"ron burgundy “great odin’s raven” special reserve, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,78,25,"what does this say about how far whisky has come? we live in an era where you can now buy the official whisky from a major motion picture. this has a deep amber color. really deep. the nose brings warm muffins, caramel, and grassy notes with a good dose of smoke. it’s a sweet concoction with a peppery kick. there’s a tinge of polypropylene before a short, clipped, spicy finish. it just needs to find more of its own identity."
"girvan no. 4 apps, 42%",Single Grain Whisky,78,76,"the entry level official girvan is named after their ‘mps’ distillation apparatus that distills at various pressures and under vacuum to vaporize and distill at lower temperatures. this is very light, with fresh whole pineapples, orange fondant creams, delicate vanilla, and risen dough. it’s fiendishly sweet (have a dental hygienist on standby), like a deep layer of butter frosting, sticky cotton candy, honey, overripe bananas, and spearmint. the expeditious finish tenders cookie mix, digestive biscuits, and a grind of pepper. £45"
"spey royal choice, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,78,250,"hailing from the speyside distillery, this has a deep orange color and an aroma of damp hay and a slightly vegetal note alongside caramel and peanut brittle. a perception of bitterness beside dried peels. the palate is thick with stewing fruits, tinned prune, and burnt sugar, with a background note of wet draff. water lifts things a little, but it's all rather sick and flabby. £150"
"highland queen, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,78,20,"the range begins with this entry-level whisky, aged for 3 years. aromas of pale toffee, vanilla, and scented, herbaceous notes can be found on the nose. it has a light, silky texture and comprises flavors of stewed fruits, with a slight bitterness behind them. plum and coffee notes expand, though it remains tart through to the buzzy finish, which is lifted by hints of chocolate. a robust and pugnacious dram."
"raasay while we wait, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,78,80,"this bottling from an unspecified highland distillery is intended to represent the style of whisky to be produced in the raasay distillery, currently under construction.  peated to a level of 15ppm, this expression has been finished in tuscan red wine casks.  4,000 bottles are available. buttery farmyard aromas, with red berries and a sense of relative youth.  silky on the palate, with intense fruit sweetness and an immediate delivery of very spicy peat. pepper and peat in a medium-length finish. £55"
"macnamara rum cask finish, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,78,37,"meaning “son of the sea,” this macnamara has a lilting sweetness that lifts from the glass, the characteristic orange-peel oil note is present, but less assertive. nectarine, murray mints, and antique shop mustiness, but a lot less aromatic than many of its contemporaries. flavors of sweet melon, golden honey, and tangy orange take off in the mouth, with tastes of white pepper, fennel, and ground ginger in hot pursuit. pepperiness penetrates an otherwise juicy finish."
"the arran malt, 12 year old, 46%",Single Malt Scotch,77,50,"nice to see arran making it to 12 years old. creamy on the palate and soothing in nature, with layers of sweetness (maple and butterscotch syrup, vanilla cream) and fruit (caramel apple, fried banana). soft, congenial finish. a low-level yet persistent nutty/burnt rubber note detracts from what would otherwise be a very fun, pleasantly sweet whisky. (note: at the time of publication, the whisky was not yet available in the u.s. price above is uk price, converted to dollars).
"
"auchentoshan 1962, 41 year old, 40.3%",Single Malt Scotch,77,2000,"this whisky comes from two bourbon casks, producing only 112 bottles. i believe it’s the most expensive lowland whisky on the market. unfortunately, its flavor doesn’t stand up to its price. while i applaud morrison bowmore's efforts to give us the opportunity to try such a mature expression of auchentoshan, i feel that the whisky is past its prime. i wouldn't describe it as overly woody, like i have other whiskies that are 41 years old. rather, i would describe it as overly funky. the whisky's aroma and flavor are very peculiar, with plenty of vegetal notes (cucumbers especially) combined with stewed fruit, golden raisins, rose petals, and spice (anise, clove). if it were $100 a bottle, i would suggest that you gather a few friends to chip in and buy a bottle, just for the experience. but at $2,000, i think we should leave this one for the collectors."
"benromach, tokaji finish, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,77,50,"a very peculiar whisky. it’s interesting in some respects, with the thick, sweet hungarian dessert wine fighting with damp peat smoke for attention. but it tastes a little disjointed, and a bit too youthful. with a few more years aging (before finishing in the tokaji wine), the flavors should integrate and mature better. but as it is, this whisky is still “work in progress.” 
"
"signatory (distilled at bunnahabhain), cask #5279, 1997 vintage, 9 year old, 59.9%",Single Malt Scotch,77,45,"the owners of bunnahabhain are making a peated version of this normally unpeated islay whisky to put in their peated blend, black bottle. but they have not yet put out, as a regular item, a peated expression of bunnahabhain for purchase. however, some of the independent bottlers got their hands on some, and this might be the first one to be offered in the u.s. it’s what you would expect a 9 year old peated bunnahabhain to taste like: toffee, vanilla fudge, and nuts (the bunny signature), kiln peat smoke, and a bit too much youthfulness. it needs a few more years to mature to acceptable levels. (bottled for binny’s beverage depot.)
"
"cragganmore 21 year old, 56%",Single Malt Scotch,77,205,"the lightness of the hue suggests a very slow maturation in refill casks, and while i tried hard to get to grips with this, i found the nose simply too discreet. there’s a hint of the burning bonfire which indicates the subtle smoke that underpins cragganmore; there’s even some parma violet, dried berries, and a hint of sulfur.
the palate picks things up a little, showing ferns, wet moss, oolong tea, and dried apple, as well as citrus and — surprisingly — some just-lit cigar fuminess. it’s all rather understated, however. this is one of my top distilleries, but compared to the recent special releases and magnificent friends of the classic malts bottlings, this is slightly underwhelming. "
"glenrothes 1996 editor’s cask #9973, 57%",Single Malt Scotch,77,375,"the second of the duo — destined for the u.s. and taiwan — is a relative youngster and has been extracted from a fresh spanish oak sherry hogshead. the combination of first-fill and smaller cask size is immediately apparent. the color is mocha dark and the nose has a distinctly sulfurous twist, behind which are black cherries dipped in chocolate, tonka bean, and leather. for me, there’s too much cask and not sufficient rothes complexities, especially on the palate."
"master of malt reference series i, 47.5%",Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,77,62,"a predominantly young blended malt heads up the first of the reference series, designed as an educational tool to help attune your palate. it’s a light, floral array, with waxed lemons, oatcakes, and peppermint. mouthfeel is thin with little structure, heavy on the barley, with hints of boiled fruit candies. sipped neat, it’s drying, with doughy notes and dried apple. water fails to enliven the experience, other than showing late lemon and icing sugar. memorize it, and move up. £37"
"grand macnish 150th anniversary edition, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,77,18,"robert mcnish conceived his recipe for a lighter style of highland whisky in glasgow in 1863 (though the brand added an ‘a’ to his surname for easier pronunciation). whole orange, ground hazelnut, and ground ginger on the nose, though it keeps pretty tight-lipped. light and sweet in the mouth, with mandarin and more pronounced ginger mid-palate before a medium-length finish of bubblegum and gooseberry. it just seems a little uninspiring given the special occasion."
"h5 iced single grain, 40%",Single Grain Whisky,77,22,"boldly, this is naturally colored (barely colored) 3 year old grain whisky presented in a tall, clear bottle. the predominant aroma of corn husks is mixed with a sentimental schoolroom whiff of white glue peeled from the fingertips. there’s wheat cracker, bread, cooked ham, dripping foliage, and chopped parsley. a clean, refreshing mouthfeel with pleasant marshmallow sweetness is nixed by flavors of corn, sliced bread, and vanilla, but they are hastily extinguished. a finishing spicy glimmer shuts down quickly too."
"the lost distillery company auchnagie (batch 2/1), 46%",Blended Scotch Whisky,77,65,"auchnagie (1812–1911) was a southern highland distillery that existed for close to a century near balluinluig, south of pitlochry. this reanimation is pale yellow in color with an abundance of young, green herbal, and foliage notes, with summer ferns, cardamom pods, and green tea. it has an ethereal, gossamer-like texture, with green apple, melon boats, and soft honey. as the layers peel away, the sweetness is dabbed with spices and black pepper before it peters out."
"clansman, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,77,14,"this highland blend has a nose of lemon peel, tangerine, and pine-scented kitchen surfaces. the whisky is young, with a sweet mandarin dressing over the grain character, barley sugars, and a gentle rumble of spice. what it lacks at this age is mouthfeel, structure, and wood influence. the finish continues the sugared orange theme, with spice and ground pepper fading to soor plooms. for what can be expected at this age, the clansman does its job well."
"douglas laing old particular (distilled at port dundas) 25 year old 1990, 51.5%",Single Grain Whisky,77,129,"squished rosehip, nuttiness, and seasoned wood, but there is little else of note on this one. the palate has corn sweetness, red fruits, pomegranate, cherry lips, and descends into soor ploom territory with more oak wood. the finish continues the woody theme with a residual baked apple note.  port dundas can be wonderful to drink, but with no shortage of good to great grain whisky on the market, i feel this one is past its best. (258 bottles) £90"
"loch lomond original, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,76,40,"since a change of ownership in 2014, the loch lomond range has been revamped, with the previous blue and black label single malt variants being dropped in favor of this repackaged nas expression. farmyard aromas on the early nose, then emerging malt and caramel. discreet oak. rounded on the palate, with immediate citrus fruits, toffee, allspice, and a suggestion of smoke. spices persist through a slightly citric, cerealy, medium-length finish."
"knockando 12 year old, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,76,48,"since diageo has included knockando in its special release program it seemed only right to reacquaint myself with the standard bottling. this is speyside in its maltiest guise. the nose is reminiscent of breakfast cereal: weetabix and bran flakes, with a whisper of vanilla. the palate is light and dusty, and you get the impression that the malt just wants to scuttle across the tongue and down the throat as quickly as possible. a shy wee mouse of a dram. £30"
"macnamara blended, 40%",Blended Scotch Whisky,76,35,"this amber-colored blend from the gaelic whisky company has sweet barley notes and gentle spice aromas. the caramels prop up the dominant flavor of cold-pressed orange oil squeezed from the peel. a crescendo of peppery spice marks the late phase and distinguishes the swallow, before a finish of tangy citrus peel with a touch of clove. perfectly straightforward blend but limited in scope, like a linear dot-to-dot connecting barley, orange peel, and spice."
"robert burns single malt, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,75,40,"this robert burns world federation arran single island malt is the calvados or poire williams of the whisky world. there's no age statement on this whisky, but it has the classic aromas and flavors of sweet pears prominent in very young distilled spirits. the vanilla notes, along with its pale color, suggest a used bourbon cask. i suppose one could treat it as an aperitif, and possibly chill it down or serve it on the rocks."
"edradour bordeaux finish, 11 year old, 55.8%",Single Malt Scotch,75,80,"citrus peel, light maple syrup, and almonds, with emerging grape and vanilla. somewhat elegant in nature, but the flavors do not especially complement each other. (exclusive to binny’s beverage depot.)

"knockando 25 year old special release 2011, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,75,220,"what a contrast with the standard bottling. here we have knockando in a hugely active cask and, sadly, its fragile character collapses under the assault. the nose is oily and sulphury with notes of sealing wax, turkish tobacco, and maraschino. the palate is dry and tannic, the opposite of what is needed for a whisky that is nutty and dusty in the first place."
"benromach organic, 43%",Single Malt Scotch,74,75,"huge oak impact for such a young whisky. fresh oak shavings, dry vanilla, and subtle toasted coconut throughout. some dried fruit, sultana, and toffee up front, but this is quickly consumed by the oak. dry, hot, resinous finish. not an old whisky, but already showing too much oak.
"
"the macallan lalique decanter, 55 year old, 40.1%",Single Malt Scotch,74,12000,"deep, thick nose, with sappy oak, dried citrus, old leather, spearmint, and background leafy smoke. nicely viscous on the palate, with similar notes as the aroma. but mid-palate the age gets the best of this whisky. the flavors flatten out and the wood dominates through the finish as the leather notes linger.
   it’s a rare treat to taste a whisky this old. if you like lalique (and have the money), then this new bottling is worth some consideration, because there are certainly moments of intrigue and pleasure on the nose and beginning of the palate. but i have tasted several other 50-plus year old macallans, and i can say with certainty that the 50 year old millennium bottling and the 1946 vintage release were better and can probably still be found for a significantly lower price (only 420 bottles available worldwide.)"
"signatory (distilled at kinclaith), cask #301446, 35 year old, 1969 vintage, 51.3%",Single Malt Scotch,73,1700,"this lowland distillery only operated from 1957-1975. huge bourbon impact on the nose and palate, along with vanilla, coconut, stewed fruit, and dried wood spice -- especially on the finish, with lingering notes of anise, espresso, very dark chocolate, and charcoal. a taste of history for sure, but this is a whisky that never was meant to be aged this long."
"gordon & macphail (distilled at port ellen), 1982 vintage, 24 year old, 40%",Single Malt Scotch,73,250,"port ellen is going to just keep getting rarer and more expensive, and the quality is going to get more variable. this one shows the traditional port ellen characteristics (seaweed, tar, charcoal, damp earth, vanilla, salt, white pepper), but it just seems to flatten out mid-palate, leading to a fairly lifeless, slightly astringent finish. i feel like some of the guts were ripped out of this whisky. bottling at a higher strength (and not chill-filtered) would have helped immensely.
"
"benromach origins, batch #1, 1999 vintage, 50%",Single Malt Scotch,72,85,"origins is benromach’s new program to highlight different aspects of whisky-making, which i think is a great idea. this expression focuses on the use of golden promise barley to make the malt, which is then aged in a sherry cask. unfortunately, there’s so much sherry here that i struggle to appreciate the impact or distinction from the golden promise barley. notes of ripe orchard fruit, tangerine, beeswax, sticky toffee pudding, and toasted almond. lingering smoke and waxed fruit stays through to the finish. a weighty benromach (from the golden promise and/or the sherry). i find the nose pleasant enough, but the sherry-induced waxed fruit component that emerges mid-palate is just too dominant. 
"
"distillery select 'croftengea' (distilled at loch lomond), 9 year old, 1997 vintage, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,72,60,"quite pale in color. very youthful and naked, with damp peat, leafy smoke, charred oak, and black licorice, pears in honey and vanilla-tinged barley. quite an eye-opener for a non-islay whisky. it’s a little green and ornery. certainly an entertaining whisky, but a few more years in the barrel would round this whisky out, meld the flavors together, and add depth. 
"
"tomintoul, 'with a peaty tang', 40%",Single Malt Scotch,72,45,"youthful, and somewhat brooding for a tomintoul. i can tell there’s some young whisky in here, as there’s a suggestion of new make spirit interwoven with notes of heather, ripe barley, raw peat, and lingering smoke. i like the concept, but wish the young component (the peated part of this whisky?) was matured a bit longer. 
"
"duncan taylor (distilled at cameronbridge), cask #3583, 28 year old, 54.4%",Grain Scotch Whisky,72,125,"its best attributes are vanilla, toasted coconut, and tropical fruit, but the rest of this grain whisky is a bit of a disappointment. it is thin, and at times harsh. a paint thinner component is evident (especially on the nose), along with more wood on the finish than this thin body can handle. two carsebridge grain scotch whiskies from duncan taylor which i have tasted recently were much better: richer and creamier, and with more balance."
"distillery select 'craiglodge' (distilled at loch lomond), 8 year old, 1998 vintage, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,71,60,"aged in a sherry cask, which adds sweet notes of toffee, caribbean rum, waxed fruit, red licorice, and fruitcake to go along with the earthy smoke and lingering peat. a much sweeter, fruitier affair than the croftengea also reviewed here, but behind all that sherry there’s still a whisky that needs a little more maturing. 
"
"edradour barolo finish, 11 year old, 57.1%",Single Malt Scotch,70,80,"earthy, fleshy notes with brooding grape notes and a gamey finish -- the nebbiolo grape influence is obvious. i enjoy barolo wine and i enjoy edradour whisky, but the flavors in this whisky mix like oil and water. (exclusive to binny’s beverage depot.)"
"highland park, cask #7380, 1981 vintage, 25 year old, 55%",Single Malt Scotch,70,225,"the sherry is very dominant and cloying, which is unfortunate. and i’m not crazy about the quality of the sherry (or perhaps even the wood it was aged in). i have great respect for both highland park and binny’s, but this is somewhat disappointing for a highland park. tasted twice, with the same opinion. (bottled for binny’s beverage depot) 
"
"distillery select 'inchmoan' (distilled at loch lomond), cask #151, 13 year old, 1992 vintage, 45%",Single Malt Scotch,63,60,"fiery peat kiln smoke, tar, and ripe barley on the nose. not overly complex, but not a problem either. on the palate, the whisky starts out acceptable enough. but by mid-palate, the whisky turns harsh and unpleasant, with petroleum and vegetal notes that continues through to the finish. (exclusive to astor wines and spirits.)
